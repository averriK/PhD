\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 An acknowledgements section is sometimes included in the front matter of a longer report, thesis, or collection to note the assistance of people whose help was crucial but not extensive enough to warrant their being listed as co-authors. Thesis advisors, technicians, and colleagues who gave advice or time are all candidates for the acknowledgements section.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 This section is often placed just after the list of tables. In articles and shorter reports, acknowledgements may be made in the end matter at the very beginning of the list of references.}}
