Discussion
Limitations and Future Work</Text>
            <Notes>The purpose of the discussion section is to interpret and contextualise your data. You should begin by reiterating the purpose of your research and your major findings. Then you might do any or all of the following: connect your findings to other research (published or that of your peers); describe any ambiguities and sources of error in the data, and suggest future experiments to resolve uncertainties; explain where you expect your work may lead, and suggest specific experiments for extending your findings; describe any conceptual or technical limitations of the research. Finally, you should explain the significance of your findings to basic science and to engineering applications. Like the previous sections, the discussion should have a clear organisation and narrative flow, whether or not you use sub-sections.

Relates results to those of others
• Cites other work discussed
• Relates results to theory
• Discuss limitations and weakness of results
• Discuss implications for further research
• Suggest applications of findings when appropriate
• Avoids undue speculations

The DISCUSSION interprets the results in light of the project's objectives. The most important goal of the DISCUSSION section is to interpret the results so that the reader is informed of the insight or answers that the results provide. The DISCUSSION should also present an evaluation of the particular approach taken by the group. For example: Based on the results, how could the experimental procedure be improved? What additional, future work may be warranted? What recommendations can be drawn?

The main body of the report is where you discuss your material. The facts and evidence you have gathered should be analysed and discussed with specific reference to the problem or issue. If your discussion section is lengthy you might divide it into section headings. Your points should be grouped and arranged in an order that is logical and easy to follow. Use headings and subheadings to create a clear structure for your material. Use bullet points to present a series of points in an easy-to-follow list. 

Discussion. Discuss the meaning of the results, stating clearly what their significance is. Compare the results with theoretical expectations and account for anything unexpected.

Explain in the discussion section of your document information presented in the results section, commenting on significant data produced by the study. In writing a discussion section, keep the following points in mind.

• Identify significant patterns in the data and relationships between variables. Offer tentative explanations for these patterns and relationships.
• Compare the actual data produced with any predictions or questions posed in the introduction or theory section of the document.
• If any of the results differ from the expected results, offer possible explanations for the discrepancies. Present the most probable explanations first and the least probable last.
• Consider how well the data answer any questions posed in the document's introduction. Do the results answer the questions completely? If not, explain what questions still need to be addressed and give possible explanations why the results may be inconclusive.
• Qualify the scope of your explanations, discussing in what cases your explanations apply and in what cases they may not.
• Organise your material in order of importance to your reader's purpose in using the document.

The introduction sets the scene and includes the aims and objectives of the report. It also defines the limits of the report, outlines the method of enquiry, gives a brief general background to the subject of the report and indicates the proposed development.

The introduction provides a framework for the story you are about to tell, and thus serves two main purposes. For one, you must provide sufficient background information for a reader to understand the forthcoming results. Just as importantly, you must motivate the audience to keep reading! How? Reveal the significance of the work through connections to both prior scientific accomplishments and future applications. You are welcome to use your own creativity and judgement as to what a good introduction should look like; however, you may find the suggested structure below useful.

Paragraph 1: most general, "big picture" paragraph. Here you should introduce the reader to the broader context of your experiment and motivate why your research is important. Be sure to tell a coherent story, not a dense but unconnected list of facts.
Paragraph 2: "zooming in" somewhat. Now that the reader has a frame for thinking about your research, you can present background information in more depth.
Paragraph 3: most specific, a description of your particular investigation.

State (1) the purpose of the investigation, (2) the problem being investigated, (3) the background (context and importance) of the problem (citing previous work by others), (4) your thesis and general approach, and (5) the criteria for your study success.

State the problem (the question)
• Put the problem in a theoretical context (in regard to other theories/articles)
• Cite earlier work on the question
• State what the study will contribute to understanding the question
• At the end of the introduction, state the principal hypotheses of the study 

The INTRODUCTION should provide a clear statement of the problem posed by the project, and why the problem is of interest. It should reflect the scenario, if available. If needed, the introduction also needs to present background information so that the reader can understand the significance of the problem. A brief summary of the unique approach your group used to solve the problem should be given, possibly also including a concise introduction to theory or concepts used later to analyse and to discuss the results.

The introduction to your document should lead your readers into your paper and give them an idea of what to expect (also see Forecasting). It should not be simply a restatement of the abstract even though it will contain some of the same material.

Introductions often do the following:

• State the subject of your document as clearly as possible
• Define the problem you are addressing, your approach to the problem, and why this problem is important
• State the purpose of your document
• Define the scope of your document
• Provide necessary and relevant background information

The introduction sets the scene for the main body of the report. The aims and objectives of the report should be explained in detail. Any problems or limitations in the scope of the report should be identified, and a description of research methods, the parameters of the research and any necessary background history should be included. </Notes>

The main body of the report is where you discuss your material. The facts and evidence you have gathered should be analysed and discussed with specific reference to the problem or issue. If your discussion section is lengthy you might divide it into section headings. Your points should be grouped and arranged in an order that is logical and easy to follow. Use headings and subheadings to create a clear structure for your material. Use bullet points to present a series of points in an easy-to-follow list. 

Discussion. Discuss the meaning of the results, stating clearly what their significance is. Compare the results with theoretical expectations and account for anything unexpected.

Explain in the discussion section of your document information presented in the results section, commenting on significant data produced by the study. In writing a discussion section, keep the following points in mind.

• Identify significant patterns in the data and relationships between variables. Offer tentative explanations for these patterns and relationships.
• Compare the actual data produced with any predictions or questions posed in the introduction or theory section of the document.
• If any of the results differ from the expected results, offer possible explanations for the discrepancies. Present the most probable explanations first and the least probable last.
• Consider how well the data answer any questions posed in the document's introduction. Do the results answer the questions completely? If not, explain what questions still need to be addressed and give possible explanations why the results may be inconclusive.
• Qualify the scope of your explanations, discussing in what cases your explanations apply and in what cases they may not.
• Organise your material in order of importance to your reader's purpose in using the document.

            <Text>Comentarios sobre las limitaciones de Sa(T) o PGA como variables predictoras
La enorme mayoría de los modelos GMPE se concentran en la predicción de la aceleración pico (PGA) del terreno, y las pseudo-aceleraciones espectrales Sa(T) que se obtienen como la aceleración máxima de un oscilador de un grado de libertad (SDOF). Estos parámetros están directamente correlacionados con los esfuerzos máximos de diseño en estructuras . En otros problemas más complejos, la demanda sísmica tienen pobre correlación con estos parámetros de intensidad (PGA, Sa(T)) y se requieren otras medidas de intensidad que caractericen la intensidad.

            <Notes>The reader wants to know what area of work the report covers.

The ABSTRACT is not a part of the body of the report itself. Rather, the abstract is a brief summary of the report contents that is often separately circulated so potential readers can decide whether to read the report. The abstract should very concisely summarise the whole report: why it was written, what was discovered or developed, and what is claimed to be the significance of the effort. The abstract does not include figures or tables, and only the most significant numerical values or results should be given.

The summary should briefly describe the content of the report. It should cover the aims of the report, what was found and what, if any, action is called for. Aim for about 1/2 a page in length and avoid detail or discussion; just outline the main points. Remember that the summary is the first thing that is read. It should provide the reader with a clear, helpful overview of the content of the report.

            <Text>mathematical models used by scientists:
Draper and Smith (1981) define three main types of mathematical models used by scientists: 
Functional. When the true functional relationship between response (the value to be predicted) and the predictor variables is known and is used. Control. When the independent effects of each of the control variables (the predictor variables) can be estimated through designed experiments. Predictive. When neither functional or control models can be used and within the data much inter-correlation exists, so called ‘problems with messy data’. They do not need to be functional.

Limitations and Future Work</Text>
            <Notes>The purpose of the discussion section is to interpret and contextualise your data. You should begin by reiterating the purpose of your research and your major findings. Then you might do any or all of the following: connect your findings to other research (published or that of your peers); describe any ambiguities and sources of error in the data, and suggest future experiments to resolve uncertainties; explain where you expect your work may lead, and suggest specific experiments for extending your findings; describe any conceptual or technical limitations of the research. Finally, you should explain the significance of your findings to basic science and to engineering applications. Like the previous sections, the discussion should have a clear organisation and narrative flow, whether or not you use sub-sections.

Relates results to those of others
• Cites other work discussed
• Relates results to theory
• Discuss limitations and weakness of results
• Discuss implications for further research
• Suggest applications of findings when appropriate
• Avoids undue speculations

The most important goal of the DISCUSSION section is to interpret the results so that the reader is informed of the insight or answers that the results provide. The DISCUSSION should also present an evaluation of the particular approach taken by the group. For example: Based on the results, how could the experimental procedure be improved? What additional, future work may be warranted? What recommendations can be drawn?

            <Notes>The contents page should list the different chapters and/or headings together with the page numbers. Your contents page should be presented in such a way that the reader can quickly scan the list of headings and locate a particular part of the report. You may want to number chapter headings and subheadings in addition to providing page references. Whatever numbering system you use, be sure that it is clear and consistent throughout.

It is useful to provide an alphabetical list of technical terms with a brief, clear description of each term. You can also include in this section explanations of the acronyms, abbreviations or standard units used in your report. 

• List of figures. Include the figure numbers, figure titles, and page numbers.
• List of tables. Include the table numbers, table titles, and page numbers.
• Nomenclature (optional). List unfamiliar terms, symbols, acronyms and their meanings.

Some readers begin by scanning the figures first. The figures, with the legends, should provide a self-explanatory overview of your data. Decide what the data show, then create figures which highlight the most important points of your paper.

Tables are used to present repetitive data that is numerical. Graphs or illustrations, collectively called figures, are used to present numerical trends, raw data (like a picture of a gel), or a model that explains your work.

When you prepare your figures and tables, keep in mind that it is significantly more expensive for journals to publish figures and tables than text, so try to present the data in a way that is worthy of such added expense. The table below is an example of an ineffective table.

The information in Table 1 could be presented in one sentence, such as: "In ten experiments carried out at 24°C, ion flow was detected only in the presence of cortical cells." This is a clearer and more concise way to present the information. In addition, all tables and figures must have numbers, titles and legends.

Legends to the figures and tables explain the elements that appear in the illustration. Conclusions about the data are NOT included in the legends. As you write your first draft, you might state in a short simple sentence what the point of the figure or table is. In later drafts, make sure each element of the figure or table is explained. Your figure legends should be written in the present tense since you are explaining elements that still exist at the time that you are writing the paper.

            <Text>Predicción del Movimiento Sísmico

El objetivo de un GMPE es poder predecir los parámetros del movimiento sísmico que deberían esperarse cuando se produce un evento de magnitud conocida, a distancia conocida, y en una region dada.
Con el fin de restringir los modelos empíricos para un rango amplio de escenarios de magnitud y distancia que se consideran dentro de los análisis probabilísticos de peligro y riesgo, generalmente es necesario compilar conjuntos de datos de movimientos del suelo de diferentes regiones. 
Cualquier diferencia que exista entre el medio de propagación, las excitaciones de la fuente o las respuestas del sitio en las regiones de las que se han obtenido los datos se manifestará como una mayor varianza en el modelo de movimiento del suelo. 
Uno de los principales retos que queda por resolver adecuadamente es cómo eliminar la suposición de ergodicidad, que asume que todos los procesos aleatorios de los cuales se derivan los movimientos sísmicos, siguen una misma función de distribución invariable en el tiempo
Luego, para poder inferir la intensidad sísmica en diferentes escenarios de magnitudes y distancia sin restringirnos a regiones geográficas específicas, se requieren modelos de predicción del movimiento sísmico que sean independientes de la función de distribución (distribution-free), a partir de inferencia no-paramétrica

 Abstract
Engineering seismology is the link between earth sciences and engineering. The main input of engineering seismology in engineering design are loading conditions which must satisfy certain conditions regarding their level and frequency of occurrence during the lifetime of a structure. One method for estimating these loading conditions is through equations based on strong ground motion recorded during previous earthquakes. These equations have a handful of independent parameters, such as magnitude and source-to-site distance, and a dependent parameter, such as peak ground acceleration (PGA) or spectral acceleration, and the coefficients in the equation are usually found by regression analysis.
This review examines such equations in terms of data selection, accelerogram processing techniques of the strong-motion records used to construct the equations, the characterisation of earthquake source, travel path and local site used and regression techniques employed to find the final equations.
It is found that little agreement has been reached in the past 30 years of ground motion estimation relation studies. Workers have chosen their techniques based on the available data, which varies greatly with geographical region. Also it is noted that there is a need to include more independent parameters into ground motion estimation equations if the large uncertainties associated with such equations are to be significantly reduced. The data required to do this is, unfortunately, scarce.

Loading conditions appropriate for a particular type of structure are expressed in terms of ground motion in the frequency and/or time domains. One method for estimating these loading conditions is through equations based on strong ground motion recorded during previous earthquakes. These equations have a handful of independent

parameters, such as magnitude and source-to-site distance, and a dependent parameter, such as peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration, and the coefficients in the equation are usually found by regression analysis. Although the equations are often referred to as attenuation relationships, attenuation relations or attenuation equations, they predict more than how ground motion varies with distance. The equations are vital to probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, as Cornell (1968) shows, and also to deter- ministic seismic hazard analysis. Hence over the past 30 years ground motion estimation equations have been much studied and many versions published.
A number of reviews of ground motion estimation studies have been made in the past which provide a good summary of the methods used, the results obtained and the problems associated with such rela- tions. Trifunac and Brady (1975, 1976) provide a brief summary and comparison of published relations. Idriss (1978) presents a comprehensive review of published ground motion estimation relations up until 1978, including a number which is not easily avail- able. Boore and Joyner (1982) provide a review of ground motion estimation studies published in 1981 and comment on empirical prediction of strong ground motion in general. Campbell (1985) contains a full survey of ground motion estimation equations up until 1985. Joyner and Boore (1988) give an excellent analysis of ground motion prediction meth- odology in general, and ground motion estimation relations in particular; Joyner and Boore (1996) update this by including more recent studies. Ambra- seys and Bommer (1995) provide an overview of relations which are used for seismic design in Europe although they do not provide details about methods used. After these studies were completed, many more equations were derived. Campbell (2002a,b,c) are three excellent recent reviews of equations for the estimation of strong ground motions and include the coefficents of, and comparisons between, 14 well- used equations.
Douglas (2001a, 2002a) summarises over 120 studies that derived equations for the estimation of peak ground acceleration and over 80 studies that derived equations for the estimation of response spectral ordinates. This article is a review of the procedures adopted in the past 30 years to derive equations for the estimation of ground motions using
strong-motion records. It seeks to compliment the recent reviews by Campbell by focussing on the methods used to derive the equations. Appendix A summarises the available equations for estimating peak ground acceleration.
The complete procedure that needs to be followed to derive ground motion estimation equations using recorded strong-motion data is outlined below:
(1) Earthquakes are recorded using strong-motion instruments to get a set of records for analysis.
(2) If the earthquakes were recorded on analogue accelerographs, which use paper or film, then the accelerograms are digitized to get the data into a form usable for numerical analysis.
(3) The digitized strong-motion records are pro- cessed to remove short- and long-period noise, which is introduced in the recording and digitization stages. This processing usually consists of fitting a zero baseline to the record and then applying a bandpass filter.
(4) A dependent variable is selected and calculated from the strong-motion records. This dependent var- iable, such as peak ground acceleration or spectral acceleration, should be useful for seismic design and analysis.
(5) Independent variables, such as magnitude and source-to-site distance, that characterise the strong- motion records in the data set are then collected for all the time-histories used.
(6) Regression analysis is performed to derive equations to estimate the dependent variable (a strong-motion parameter) given the independent var- iables. At the same time, the standard deviation of the equations are calculated.
(7) The derived equations are used in seismic hazard analysis, either deterministic or probabilistic, to give estimates of the strong ground motion that could be expected at a site during a future earthquake.
2. Strong ground motion parameters
Peak ground acceleration (PGA) is still often used as a parameter to describe strong ground motion although it is only useful for analysis of short period (T]0.3 s) structures. PGA is simply the amplitude of the largest peak acceleration recorded on an accelero- gram at a site during a particular earthquake. PGA is

the simplest strong-motion parameter and hence more than 120 equations (Douglas, 2001a, 2002a) have been derived in the past to predict it. These equations are discussed in this article.
Consider the SDOF system illustrated in Fig. 1. This system consists of a mass m, moving on a frictionless surface, driven by a horizontal ground motion with acceleration Utt, with a spring with stiff- ness k and a dashpot with a coefficient of viscous damping c.
Let u(t) be the horizontal displacement of the mass at time t. Then using Newton’s second law and resolving forces horizontally gives:
mutt þcut þkuþmUtt 1⁄40
Dividing by m and letting x02 = k/m and n0 = c/2x0 m
yields the equation of motion:
utt þ 2n0x0ut þ x20u 1⁄4 􏰀Utt: ð1Þ
Eq. (1) is usually used to model the elastic response of structures to earthquake excitation, see for example Chopra (1995). Under intense ground motion struc- tures often deform beyond their linear elastic range and behave inelastically. A more complex model than that given in Eq. (1) is required to model such inelastic behaviour, see for example Chopra (1995, chap. 7). These models are not considered here.
During an earthquake although the response of a structural system changes with time, which may be important for some applications, often only the max- imum response which a system undergoes is required

for design purposes. Consider the structural model illustrated in Fig. 1 and assume the ground acceler- ation is Utt(t) and the mass, m, has displacement u(t), velocity ut(t) and acceleration utt(t) then the three values of maximum response of interest are:

maximum relative response velocity, maxtAutA;
maximum relative response displacement, maxtAuA.
Sa = Sv = Sd =
 ground acceleration. The undamped natural period of the system is
Two forces act on the mass one is due to the spring and the other due to the equivalent viscous damping. These forces must resist the total inertial forces of the system, mutt and mUtt hence, mSa gives the maximum force acting which must be resisted by the entire system.
From these quantities, two ‘pseudo’ values can be calculated:
maximum absolute pseudo-acceleration, SaV=(2p/ T)2Sd;
maximum relative pseudo-velocity, SvV=(2p/T)Sd;
where T is the natural period of the system.
mSaV gives the force which must be resisted by the spring (Chopra, 1995) and not the complete system. For small coefficients of critical damping and rela- tively short periods Sa and SaVare almost identical
(Chopra, 1995).
Maximum relative pseudo-velocity, SvV, is related
to the peak value of strain energy, ES, stored in the system during the earthquake by the equation: ES = mSvV2/2 (Chopra, 1995, p. 200).
A plot of the quantities defined above as a function of the natural vibration period, T, and damping, n, of the system is called a response spectrum. It provides a convenient means of summarizing the peak response of all possible linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems to a particular component of ground motion (Chopra, 1995).
Over 80 equations Douglas (2001a, 2002a) have been derived in the past to predict response spectral ordinates because response spectra have proved to be useful for seismic analysis of structures. These equa- tions are also discussed in this article.

3. Types of ground motion estimation equations
Draper and Smith (1981) define three main types of mathematical models used by scientists:
Functional. When the true functional relationship between response (the value to be predicted) and the predictor variables is known and is used. Control. When the independent effects of each of the control variables (the predictor variables) can be estimated through designed experiments. Predictive. When neither functional or control models can be used and within the data much inter-correlation exists, so called ‘problems with messy data’. They do not need to be functional.
Most published ground motion estimation relations have some physical basis, hence some aspects of functional models are present. Since all the physical aspects associated with seismic ground motion are not known in detail and even if they were, it would be impossible to express them in the form of one simple equation, ground motion estimation relations are pre- dictive models. Trifunac (1980) notes that ground motion estimation relations should be based on a functional form from the physical nature of phenom- ena but because of lack of data this cannot be achieved; Caillot and Bard (1993) also state that the form of the equation must have some physical basis. Controlled experiments cannot obviously be per- formed with ground motion caused by earthquakes because no two earthquakes are the same, nor are the travel paths to station or the local site conditions and hence there is no repeatability.1 Therefore control models are not possible.
4. Data selection criteria
Early ground motion estimation studies (e.g. Milne and Davenport, 1969; Esteva, 1970; Ambraseys, 1975) give little or no information on the data selec- tion criteria adopted, probably because at that time few strong-motion records were available and to ensure that the number of records used was not too
1 Explosions fired at test sites approximate to repeat runs for travel time studies.
small no selection was made. This section concerns what criteria have been applied in the past for the selection of records; in Section 10 selection based on site conditions is discussed.
A major choice made is: data from which country, region or seismotectonic regime will be used. Most often, authors only use data from one country (or part of the country), for example western North America (mainly California) (e.g. Milne and Davenport, 1969; Esteva, 1970; Joyner and Boore, 1981; Crouse and McGuire, 1996; Chapman, 1999) or Japan (e.g. Iwa- saki et al., 1980; Kawashima et al., 1984; Kamiyama et al., 1992; Molas and Yamazaki, 1995; Kobayashi et al., 2000). For these two regions, there are many time- histories from a wide distribution of magnitudes, distances and other seismological parameters such as source mechanism so the coefficients derived through regression are stable and not controlled by few data points. Trifunac (1976) does not use data from regions, other than western USA, because attenuation varies with geological province and magnitude deter- mination is different in other countries. Even for those authors who use a criteria based on a particular region, differences can still occur, for example Crouse and McGuire (1996) and Sadigh et al. (1997) both develop equations for use in California but Crouse and McGuire (1996) exclude data from the Mammoth Lakes area (which is an active volcanic region) because it is atypical of the rest of California whereas Sadigh et al. (1997) include 65 records from the Mammoth Lakes area.
Others have also limited their data to those re- corded within one country, for example Italy (Sabetta and Pugliese, 1987; Mohammadioun, 1991; Tento et al., 1992; Caillot and Bard, 1993). Such criteria though is artificial because each country is not a single seismotectonic regime and nor are earthquakes from one country completely different to those in another. To limit the data by such criteria can lead to a small suite of records with a limited spread of independent parameters, for example Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) use 95 records from 17 earthquakes with magnitudes between 4.6 and 6.8. This means the equation may be controlled by a few data points and for independent variables outside this limited range predictions could be incorrect, a problem which Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) themselves note. Some areas, for example Iceland (Sigbjo ̈rnsson and Bald-
 
vinsson, 1992) and Hawaii (Munson and Thurber, 1997), seem to have much different attenuation prop- erties than non-volcanic regions which means devel- oping equations based solely on data from these small areas may be justified although again there is a lack of data. Zhao et al. (1997) exclude some New Zealand records which may have been affected by different attenuation properties in volcanic regions.
To overcome the lack of records some authors supplement their data with accelerograms from other regions of the world which are felt to be tectonically similar. For example, Campbell (1981) uses eight records from outside western USA (from shallow tectonic plate boundaries) because they make an important contribution to understanding near-source ground motion and this outweighs differences which may exist due to tectonics and recording practice. Differences in anelastic attenuation between the dif- ferent areas are minimized by using only near-source records and he uses only data from instruments with similar dynamic characteristics to avoid problems due to recording practice. This increases the distribution of the data space so that the derived equations have a greater applicability. McCann and Echezwia (1984) also use data from outside western North America, even though tectonics and travel paths may be differ- ent, because additional information in the near field is considered more important. Theodulidis and Papaza- chos (1992) supplement their Greek data with 16 records from other regions (Japan and Alaska) to increase the number of records from large (7.0V M V 7.5) shallow earthquakes which can occur in Greece but for which no Greek strong-motion records exist. Fukushima et al. (1988) use 200 records, from distances 0.1 – 48 km, from western USA to constrain the near-source behaviour of the ground motion estimation equation because Japanese data from this distance range are lacking.
Ground motion estimation relations have been derived for particular tectonic regimes and not simply based on a country’s borders. Dahle et al. (1990b) present a study using records from worldwide intra- plate areas, defined as tectonically stable and geo- logically more uniform than plate boundaries, although due to lack of data they choose data from ‘reasonably’ intraplate areas. Spudich et al. (1996, 1999) find equations for extensional regimes (where lithosphere is expanding ‘areally’) using worldwide
data. Crouse (1991) includes data from any zone with strong seismic coupling, such as younger subduction zones, unless there are compelling reasons to exclude data. This is done because there are not enough data available from Cascadia, which is his area of interest. A number of workers (Abrahamson and Litehiser, 1989; Ambraseys and Bommer, 1991; Ambraseys, 1995; Ambraseys et al., 1996; Sarma and Srbulov, 1996; Campbell, 1997; Bozorgnia et al., 2000) derived equations for shallow crustal earthquakes using data from wide regions, including the whole earth, because, it is felt that such earthquakes and regions are similar worldwide. Campbell (1997) includes shallow subduction interface earthquakes in his mainly shallow crustal set of records, because previous studies have found that their near-source ground motion is similar to that from shallow crustal earthquakes. The distance calibration functions of regional local magnitude scales for different parts of the world are examined by Boore (1989) and it is found that they are similar to distances of about 100 km but differ beyond that. Boore (1989) thinks that this is because differing anelastic attenuation and wave propagation effects in different crustal structures should not play a large role at close distances. There- fore within the range where ground motions have engineering significance (about 100 km) data from different parts of the whole could be combined as far as distance dependence is concerned.
Criteria based on source depth have been used as an earthquake selection criterion (see Table 1).
A minimum magnitude criterion is often applied (see Table 2). A natural constraint on the minimum magnitude, which often occurs for spectral ordinates, is that records from analogue instruments of small magnitude earthquakes are not always digitized, because digitization is a time-consuming and expen- sive process. Therefore the digital forms of such records, from which response spectra are calculated, are not available and so such records cannot be used for deriving ground motion estimation equations. This constraint does not occur for records from digital accelerographs, which are becoming more common, because they are recorded directly in digital form. Blume (1977) and Ambraseys (1995) study the effect of different minimum magnitude cut-offs; Ambraseys (1995) finds that the cut-off used has little effect on ground motion estimates. Selection based on accuracy

bell (1981) and Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) by including only earthquakes with locations (epicentres or rupture distance) known to within 5 km or less. Other studies use previously published ground motion estimation relations to impose magnitude dependent distance limits. Fukushima and Tanaka (1990) remove records with predicted PGA &lt; 0.1 m s 􏰀 2 (the assumed trigger level) to avoid biasing the attenuation rate, Fukushima et al. (1995) exclude records with pre- dicted PGV &lt; 0.1 cm s 􏰀 1 so precise attenuation is found and Kobayashi et al. (2000) exclude data from distances with predicted PGA &lt; 0.02 m s 􏰀 2.
Previous studies have tried to reduce possible bias due to using records from large distances which may not be typical of the attenuation rate, through two alternative procedures. Joyner and Boore (1981) exclude records from distances greater than or equal to shortest distance to an instrument which did not trigger. This has been made more strict by Boore et al. (1993) who exclude records from distances greater than the distance to the first record triggered on the S wave and for spectral ordinates exclude records from distances greater than the distance to the first non- digitized record (which is assumed to be of smaller amplitude than the digitized records). Boore et al. (1994a) conclude that this criterion may be over strict because it is independent of geology and azimuth. Ambraseys and Bommer (1991) and Spudich et al. (1996, 1999) do not use such a criterion because their sets of records are non-homogeneous and from irreg- ularly spaced networks with different and unknown trigger levels, thus making such a criterion difficult or impossible to apply. Crouse (1991) also does not

Minimum and maximum distance criteria are sometimes applied for a variety of reasons. Blume (1977) investigates the effect of using different dis- tance cut-offs. McGuire (1977) excludes records with epicentral or rupture distance smaller than one-half the estimated length of rupture to exclude those records from the near-source region which are governed by different physical laws than those far from the source. A minimum distance criterion, of 2 km, was applied by Wang et al. (1999) because 2 km is the minimum error in epicentral locations and hence including records from smaller distances may give errors in the results. Lack of far-field data motivates Molas and Yamazaki (1995) to exclude records from greater than 200 km and Crouse et al. (1988) to remove data with distances or magnitudes well outside the range of most selected records. Campbell (1981, 1997), uses only near-source records to avoid complex propaga- tion effects observed at longer distances. Only records associated with reliable distances are used by Camp-

apply this criterion but considers his sample adequate for regression and although it may overestimate smaller distant motion, it would properly estimate larger motions which are of greater concern for design. Although this is true, the ground motion estimation equation obtained would not predict the median hazard at all distances and therefore the use of it in seismic hazard analysis, for example, which requires the 50% hazard curve would bias the results. The other method for removing bias due to non- triggered instruments is the regression based method of Campbell and Bozorgnia (1994), Campbell (1997) and Chapman (1999) which uses all the available strong-motion data to derive ground motion estima- tion relations to predict the non-triggering cut-off distance.
Exclusion of records based on minimum PGA has been proposed as a selection criteria (see Table 3). Blume (1977) studies effect of different PGA cut-offs but Blume (1980) does not employ a PGA cut-off because it is, by itself, a poor index of damage in most cases.
Time-history quality is also a criterion used by some authors. Campbell (1981) only includes records which triggered early enough to capture the strong phase of shaking and hence the ground motion is not underestimated. Dahle et al. (1990b) exclude records which are not available unprocessed and without sufficient information on instrument natural frequency and damping. Lee (1995) only uses records with high

signal-to-noise ratio. Youngs et al. (1997) remove poor quality time-histories and those which do not contain the main portion of shaking from their set of data. Records of short duration terminating early in the coda are not including in the analysis of Chapman (1999). Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) use only the first shock of a record if it is a well separated multiple shock record and magnitude and focal parameters apply only to first shock. All these criteria are valid and would help to reduce some of the scatter in the ground motion but less subjective methods are required if records are not simply rejected because they do not seem to match the rest of the data. Cousins et al. (1999) retain data from clipped seismograms.
It is common to use only those records which are not significantly affected by soil-structure interaction although many alternative suggestions have been made on how to select such records (see Tables 4 and 5 which give the first time that an author applies a particular criterion).
Ohsaki et al. (1980a), Campbell (1981) and Crouse and McGuire (1996) remove records thought to be affected by high topographical relief.
Criteria are sometimes used to achieve a set of data which will not lead to biased results simply because of its distribution. McGuire (1978) uses no more than seven records from the same earthquake and no more than nine from a single site to minimize underestima- tion of variance and he retains records to give a large distance and magnitude range. Campbell (1981) and Devillers and Mohammadioun (1981) do not use all data from San Fernando to minimize bias due to the large number of records. This problem is also noted by Trifunac (1976) who screens the data to minimize possible bias due to uneven distribution of data amongst different magnitude ranges and soil condi- tions and from excessive contribution to the database from several abundantly recorded earthquakes. Boore et al. (1993) do not use data from more than one station with the same site condition within a circle of radius 1 km so that the underestimation of variance is minimized. Niazi and Bozorgnia (1991) select earth- quakes to cover broad range of magnitude, distance and azimuth and to ensure thorough coverage of whole SMART-1 array (at least 25 stations recorded each shock). Other criteria for the minimum number of records per earthquake used are three or more (Atkinson, 1997) and two or more (Abrahamson and

Therefore even though they do not include site intensity as an independent parameter explicitly, to use their equations still requires a pre- diction of the intensity which will occur at the site, along with choosing the magnitude and distance. Hence they require the user to make a choice for a parameter, site-intensity, which if known would mean there would be little reason for using a ground motion estimation relation to predict the response spectrum at the site. Mohammadioun (1994b) highlights another problem with the technique because the recording site intensities may be average intensities within the area of the site and hence would neglect possible micro- zoning effects. A more technical problem is men- tioned by Mohammadioun (1991), who does not use intensity-based selection for his derivation of spectral equations for Italy because of the risk of creating a data population which is not statistically significant.

strong-motion records were corrected (e.g. Milne and Davenport, 1969; Esteva, 1970; Ambraseys, 1975), thus either uncorrected records were used or standard correction procedures were employed. Since the paper of Trifunac (1976) who gives frequencies between which the accelerations used are thought to be accu- rate, details of correction techniques used for deriving ground motion estimation relations have often been reported, but again, like data selection procedures, there is little agreement about the best method to use. However, because time-histories from different types of accelerographs have been used and because of the wide variety of levels of ground motion that have been used in different studies, there is no general best procedure. Tento et al. (1992) state that correction procedure plays a relevant role in analysis and that it introduces inhomogeneities and errors due to the subjective choice of low frequency filter limits.
Almost all studies, where details are given, have filtered their strong-motion records using a variety of passbands and types of filter. The cut-off frequencies used either have been the same for all records or have been chosen for each record individually using a
number of different techniques. Table 6 summarises the methods for individually selecting low and high cut-off frequencies and the frequencies chosen.
Some authors have applied standard filter cut-offs to their records apparently irrespective of the quality of time-histories. Gaull (1988) bandpass filters his records to get the PGA associated with periods between 2 and 10 Hz, because high frequency PGA from uncorrected records is not of engineering sig- nificance. Although this is true, because the PGA is often used to anchor a response spectrum at zero period, using the PGA not associated with high frequencies to estimate the spectrum is incorrect. Dahle et al. (1990b) use an elliptical filter with passband 0.25 – 25 Hz. Niazi and Bozorgnia (1992) use a trapezoidal filter with corner frequencies 0.07, 0.10, 25 and 30.6 Hz. Kamiyama et al. (1992) filter with passband 0.24 and 11 Hz. Molas and Yamazaki (1995) use a low-cut filter with cosine shaped tran- sition from 0.01 to 0.05 Hz. For long records (more than 10 s duration) and some shorter records (between 5 and 10 s duration), Ambraseys et al. (1996) use a passband 0.20 – 25 Hz. Sarma and Srbulov (1996)

employ a low pass elliptical filter. Caillot and Bard (1993) use cut-offs 0.5 and 30 Hz. The application of the same cut-off frequencies for all accelerograms used is justified for those studies which use a homo- geneous set of records recorded on the same type of instrument and digitized in the same way (e.g. Niazi and Bozorgnia, 1992; Molas and Yamazaki, 1995). For those authors who use strong-motion records from a wide variety of sources which have been recorded on different types of instrument and have different digitization qualities (Dahle et al., 1990b; Ambraseys et al., 1996; Sarma and Srbulov, 1996) using such a general procedure is probably not justified. Bommer et al. (1998) show, however, that the choice of the cut- off frequencies does not significantly affect spectral ordinates for periods within the range of main engi- neering interest (about 0.1 – 2 s), therefore a common correction may not affect the results. For special structures, with periods longer than 2 s, the cut-off frequency used could be important.
Since the paper of Trifunac (1976), removal of the transducer response (instrument correction) from the time-history is often performed (e.g. Sabetta and Pugliese, 1987; Spudich et al., 1996; Cousins et al., 1999). The need to correct records from Japanese instruments to yield reliable PGAs, because they substantially suppress high frequencies, is noted by Kawashima et al. (1986). Data from seismographs also needs to be instrument corrected because of their different frequency response compared with accelero- graphs Cousins et al. (1999). Instrument correction requires, at least, the natural frequency and damping of the accelerograph, information which is sometimes lacking and hence such corrections cannot be applied (Ambraseys et al., 1996). Chiaruttini and Siro (1981) do not correct their Friuli records for instrument response but find this does not substantially alter PGA and Bommer et al. (1998) do not employ instru- ment correction because it is not important for dis- placement spectra.
Whether the corrected or uncorrected PGAs should be included is another topic of debate. Campbell (1981) uses PGA from unprocessed accelerograms because fully processed PGAs are generally smaller due to decimation and filtering of records. Uncor- rected PGAs are also used by Munson and Thurber (1997). Other studies, it is supposed, use corrected PGAs. Ambraseys and Bommer (1991) and Ambra-
seys (1995) use PGAs from accelerograms which have undergone a wide variety of different processing techniques, including no correction, for their studies. They find that most differences (which they can check) are small (below 4% or 5%) but for some records the differences may be larger (up to 10%). Munson and Thurber (1997) also find small differ- ences between uncorrected and corrected PGA. Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) find their correction technique provides reliable estimates of PGA and hence uncorrected PGA values do not need to be used. Accelerogram correction procedures are used to find the actual ground motion which occurred at the site therefore uncorrected PGA values are not the real PGAs. There is an inconsistency between using uncorrected estimates of PGA but correcting the records to find spectral ordinates which leads to the PGA ground motion estimation equation not matching the spectral ordinate equations at high frequencies. However, such differences are probably small enough to be neglected when compared with other assump- tions made.
A few studies have included other sources of PGA values apart from those given on accelerograms. Chiaruttini and Siro (1981) use some PGA estimates from velocity time-histories. Garcia-Fernandez and Canas (1995) only use PGA values derived from Fourier amplitude spectra at 5 Hz from short-period analogue time-histories. Cousins et al. (1999) differ- entiate seismograms to yield PGA estimates. Such techniques to supplement a limited set of records, particularly in the far field where accelerographs may not be triggered, are useful but estimates of PGA from the transformation of measurements from instruments with much different characteristics than accelero- graphs must be verified to be consistent with those from accelerographs.
The choice of correction method strongly affects the range of periods within which the spectral ordi- nates calculated can be assumed to be correct and not significantly affected by the correction procedure. This question has started to be discussed recently because seismic design is becoming more interested in long- period ground motion which is the range most affected by noise and hence by the correction technique, which seeks to remove this noise but in the process also removes information on the actual ground motion. Mohammadioun (1991) provides no ground motion

estimation equations for periods greater than 2 s because he uses uncorrected time-histories which contain long-period noise. The 2 s limit on the accept- ability of the derived equations is also noted by Tento et al. (1992), who find that the record dependent correction procedure they adopt significantly affects the results for periods greater than 2 s. Boore et al. (1993) also only provide spectral ordinate equations for periods between 0.1 and 2 s because of the low sampling rate of older time-histories, low signal-to- noise ratios and filter cut-offs affecting spectral ordi- nates for periods outside this range. Lee (1995) believes his records are not adequate for response spectrum calculation outside the period range 0.04 – 2 s. An even shorter period range for acceptable spectral ordinates is stated by Theodulidis and Papazachos (1994), who believe that for periods greater than 0.5 s the different digitization (manual or automatic) and correction (baseline fitting or filtering) techniques they have used means longer period values are significantly affected. Niazi and Bozorgnia (1992) believe their low frequency cut-off may be too low for records from small earthquakes but choosing a higher frequency for this cut-off would remove information on long-period ground motion. If they adopted a record dependent correction procedure and then in deriving long-periods equations use only those records which did not require a higher frequency cut-off, this problem would be overcome. Such a method has been adopted by a number of recent workers (Spudich et al., 1996, 1999; Abrahamson and Silva, 1997; Bommer et al., 1998). Spudich et al. (1996) use spectral values only from the passband of the filter. Abrahamson and Silva (1997) use spectral values only within frequency band 1.25fh to 0.8fl (where fh is the high-pass corner fre- quency and fl is the low-pass corner frequency). Spudich et al. (1999) uses a similar criteria of only using spectral ordinates within 1.25fh and 0.75fl and for eight records which were processed in a different way the acceptable range was 0.1 – 1 s. Bommer et al. (1998) use each record’s spectral ordinates for regres- sion up to 0.1 s less than the period of the filter cut-off used for that record. These techniques mean that the number of records and distribution of records used for the regression analysis changes with period and hence it must be checked that for each period the number and distribution of data points is adequate to derive reliable coefficients. There may be a problem of consistency
between spectral estimates, derived from the ground motion estimation relations, for short periods, for which probably most of the records were used, com- pared with long periods, for which the stronger ground motions are probably more represented.
6. Combination of horizontal measurements
Most accelerograms consist of three mutually orthogonal components: two horizontal and one ver- tical. Seven different ways of combining the horizon- tal components have been investigated, these are given below.
(1) Arithmetic mean: aM=[maxAa1(t)Afor t + maxAa2(t)Afor t]/2.
(2) Both: aB,1 = maxAa1(t)Afor t and aB,2 = maxAa2(t)Afor t.

(3) Geometric mean: a1⁄4

G maxAa1ðtÞAfor tmaxAa2ðtÞAfor t. Note that: log aG=
{log [maxAa1(t)Afor t] + log [maxAa2(t)Afor t]/2.
(4) Largest component: aL = max[maxAa1(t)Afor t,
maxAa2(t)Afor t].
(5) Random: ar = maxAa1(t)Afor t or ar =
maxAa2(t)Afor t, chosen randomly.
(6) Resultant: aR=max[maxAa1(t)cos h+a2(t)sin
hAfor t]for h. Correct calculation of this combination requires that the two horizontal components records are perfectly aligned with respect to time and that they are exactly mutually perpendicular. This may not always be true, especially for digitized accelerograms from mechnically triggered analogue instruments.

V maxAa1ðtÞAfor t þ maxAa2ðtÞAfor t: This assumes that the maximum ground amplitudes occur simulta- neously on the two horizontal components; this is a
conservative assumption.
Using both horizontal components or the geometric
mean of the two components leads to exactly the same regression coefficients when logarithms of the ground motion measurements are used. This can be demon- strated by considering the normal equations which are solved to give the least squares estimate of the coefficients Douglas (2001b). The standard deviation of the equation derived using both horizontal compo- nents will, however, usually be different to the stand- ard deviation of the equation derived using the geometric mean of the two horizontal components.

7. Separation of ground motion estimation relations into source, path and site dependence
Traditionally discussion of ground motion from earthquakes has been split into three sections: source, travel path and site; upon which the ground motion at the site depends. This separation is somewhat sim- plistic, because the boundaries between each part are not clearly defined and because the source affects the path’s properties and path properties affect site con- ditions. This separation though will be followed here because it makes reviewing previous ground motion estimation relationships easier but it is complicated by the previously described problems and by the use of non-linear equations in which source, path and site parameters are not separated.
The following discussion is in terms of the untrans- formed ground motion, y, as opposed to log y on which the regression is almost always performed.
8. Characterisation of source
Earthquake magnitude, M, has been almost the only parameter used to characterise the earthquake source in ground motion estimation relations, al- though many different magnitude scales and combi- nations of scales have been used. Recently parameters associated with the source mechanism have also been included although again there are a number of alter- native methods for including this information in the equation.
Early studies (e.g. Esteva, 1970; Donovan, 1973), did not state which magnitude scale they use. Many authors use local magnitude (also called Richter magnitude), ML, to derive their ground motion esti- mation relations (e.g. McGuire, 1977; Campbell, 1989; Tento et al., 1992; Mohammadioun, 1994b). This may be because these are the only magnitude estimates available for the chosen earthquakes. Chiar- uttini and Siro (1981) use ML because it is determined at short distances, it is homogeneously determined for small earthquakes up to saturation at about ML = 7.0 and because it is determined at about 1 Hz which is close to the accelerometer band. Mohammadioun (1994b) uses ML because it is generally available and is uniformly determined but states that it may not be the best choice. Ambraseys (1995) does not use
ML because there are no ML estimates for many of the earthquakes in his set and many estimates of ML are unreliable. Boore (1989) states that ML is difficult to predict for design earthquakes because catalogues of historical earthquakes often contain unreliable ML estimates.
Another magnitude scale which is commonly used is surface-wave magnitude, Ms (Dahle et al., 1990b; Ambraseys and Bommer, 1991; Ambraseys, 1995; Ambraseys et al., 1996; Crouse and McGuire, 1996; Bommer et al., 1998). Dahle et al. (1990b) use Ms because it is reasonably unbiased with respect to source dimensions and there is a globally consistent calculation method. Theodulidis and Papazachos (1992) mainly use Ms but for the foreign earthquakes in their set they use Mw or MJMA which they state to be equivalent between 6.0 and 8.0. Ambraseys (1995) states that the conversion of ML to Ms should not be done because of uncertainty in conversion which should be retained. This holds for all conversions between magnitude scales but because only Mw can be found for all size earthquakes conversion from one scale to another is often necessary at small and large magnitudes, for example Dahle et al. (1990b) and Ambraseys et al. (1996) use some Ms converted from other magnitude scales (ML, mb, coda length magni- tude). Japanese Meteorological Agency magnitude, MJMA, has been employed in many Japanese ground motion estimation relations (e.g. Kawashima et al., 1984; Kamiyama et al., 1992; Fukushima et al., 1995) although Kawashima et al. (1984) notes that it may not necessarily be the most suitable parameter to represent magnitude but it is the only one which exists for all earthquakes in their set of records. Peng et al. (1985) use Chinese surface-wave magnitude but also use mb and Ms and find larger residuals. When using Ms, it is important that the measurements are corrected for focal depth, which significantly affects the esti- mates of Ms for earthquakes with focal depths greater than 20 km (e.g. Herak et al., 2001).
Recently most equations have been derived using moment magnitude, Mw, (e.g. Boore et al., 1993; Lawson and Krawinkler, 1994; Sadigh et al., 1997; Kobayashi et al., 2000) which is directly related to the size of the source and the slip along the fault, unlike other magnitude scales which are empirically derived and have no physical meaning. The other major advantage of Mw is that it does not saturate for large

magnitudes, and can be calculated for small magni- tudes, and hence provides a good measure of the energy released over the entire magnitude range. The size and slip of historical earthquakes can be found using geological data which can then be directly related to Mw for use in assessing the design earthquake; this is more difficult to do for other magnitude scales (Boore, 1989). However, Mw is not usually calculated for earthquakes with magni- tudes less than about 5 and also it has only been uniformly calculated since 1977 and hence for earlier earthquakes estimates of Mw are more difficult, if not impossible, to find. To overcome these difficulties some authors (e.g. Joyner and Boore, 1981; Xu et al., 1984; Crouse, 1991; Dahle et al., 1995) have used magnitudes from other scales (e.g. ML, Ms) as esti- mates of Mw for those earthquakes which do not have a published Mw value. If only a few earthquakes in the set of data do not have a Mw value, if the magnitude scale chosen to supplement Mw is equivalent to moment magnitude for that size of earthquake and if the number of records associated with these earth- quakes is small then this method is satisfactory.
The other main technique for providing a homo- geneous magnitude scale for all sizes of earthquakes is to use one magnitude scale for small earthquakes, usually ML and one scale for larger earthquakes, usually Ms. Campbell (1981) introduced this idea to develop magnitude estimates that are generally con- sistent with Mw. He tried different division points, for the change from ML to Ms, between 5.5 and 6.5 and found that the magnitude is quite insensitive to choice, but he uses 6.0 as do Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989). Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) use 5.5 as the change-over point from ML to Ms and find that this combined magnitude scale assures a linear relationship between logarithm of PGA and magnitude and avoids saturation effects of ML. Niazi and Bozorgnia (1991) use 6.6 as the division point. Lee (1993) uses ML for M]6.5 and other different (unspecified) magnitude scales for M&gt;6.5. He does this because seismic hazard analysis often uses catalogues which do not specify magnitude scale and often the estimates are nonhomogeneous. Even though this may be so, increasing the uncer- tainty associated with the ground motion estimation relation by using a mixture of magnitude scales means that it can never be correctly used for seismic
hazard analysis because there is no correct magni- tude scale and the uncertainties are then increased unnecessarily.
Almost all studies include a factor which has an exponential dependence on magnitude, exp aM, this is because the energy released by an earthquake is exponentially dependent on magnitude (Richter, 1958).
It has been proposed that strong ground motion does not increase without bound for increasing mag- nitudes and that as magnitude increases ground motion does not increase at a constant rate. This is known as magnitude saturation. Bolt and Abraham- son (1982) split their data into four broad magnitude groups and fit an equation, which has no magnitude- dependent factors to the ground motion within each group. They find no systematic increase in near- source PGA as a function of magnitude although the derived equations predict lower PGA for larger magnitudes which, as Joyner and Boore (1983) point out, is not realistic. Hence this study may be biased by a lack of data for large magnitudes. Trifunac (1976) was the first to include a factor to model magnitude saturation, by using a factor that is expo- nentially dependent on the magnitude squared, i.e. exp bM2, in addition to the normal factor exp aM. For a positive coefficient, a and a negative coeffi- cient, b, it predicts a maximum ground motion which could occur however great the magnitude. Such factors have been included by, for example Trifunac (1980), Joyner and Fumal (1984), Huo and Hu (1991), Boore et al. (1993), Lee (1995), Lawson and Krawinkler (1994), Chapman (1999) and Abra- hamson and Silva (1997). Other authors (Joyner and Boore, 1981; Kawashima et al., 1984; Crouse et al., 1988; Crouse, 1991) incorporate factors like exp bM2 into their equations but find that the coefficient b is not statistically significant or that it does not improve the adjusted multiple correlation coefficient so remove the factor. Modelling quadratic dependence on magnitude requires records from large magnitude earthquakes that are often lacking Trifunac (1976). To overcome this lack of data, Spudich et al. (1996, 1999) adopt coefficients, a and b, from Boore et al. (1993). Lee (1995) uses only records with M z 4.25 so that a and b have the correct sign to give magnitude saturation for large magnitudes. Needing to apply such methods to force physically realistic

coefficients suggests that magnitude saturation is not supported by the data used and that excluding the factor, exp bM2, would be preferable. However, magnitude saturation is supported theoretically, see for example Douglas (2002b).
Factors which are exponentially proportional to higher powers of magnitude have been incorporated into equations by Sadigh et al. (1997), who include a factor exp k1M2.5, Abrahamson and Silva (1997) who include a factor exp k2(8.5 􏰀 M)3, and Youngs et al. (1997), who include a factor exp k3M3, for the pre- diction of spectral acceleration. Campbell (1997) uses a non-linear magnitude dependent term, exp k4 tanh M.
Kamiyama et al. (1992) take the idea of magnitude saturation to its extreme by modelling PGA as com- pletely independent of magnitude up to a distance which is exponentially dependent on magnitude. For distances greater than this near-source zone the pre- dicted ground motion is exponentially dependent on magnitude.
An alternative method for modelling different magnitude dependence for small and large earth- quakes is to derive separate equations for Mw &lt; 6.5 and for Mw z 6.5 (e.g. Sadigh et al., 1997; Sadigh and Egan, 1998). This technique relies on a large set of data that is well distributed in terms of magnitude so that there is enough data to derive reliable equations for the separate subsets, although Sadigh et al. (1997) constrain the predictions to be the same at Mw = 6.5.
Ambraseys (1995) notes that because the conver- sion of Ms to Mw is non-linear, there is a non-linear relationship between Mw and ground motion predic- tion using an equation derived using Ms. Hence some degree of magnitude saturation is implicit in ground motion estimation relations based on Ms, even if only a factor exp aMs is included, because Ms saturates at large magnitudes and so the equation does not predict constantly increasing ground motion for increasing earthquake size (as measured by Mw). This form of magnitude saturation, however, is not constrained by the strong-motion data used to derive the equation.
Fig. 2 compares the scaling of horizontal peak ground acceleration with Mw for some recent equa- tions derived using data from shallow crustal earth- quakes. This figure shows the magnitude saturation of near-field PGA modelled in some recent studies (e.g.
Sadigh et al., 1997; Campbell and Bozorgnia, 1994) and the implicit magnitude saturation of the equation by Ambraseys et al. (1996).
Some studies may implicitly account for source mechanism by including many shocks from the same area which have a similar mechanism, for example Trifunac (1976) notes that the large proportion of data from the San Fernando earthquake he uses may bias the results.
Campbell (1981) examines residuals from regres- sion and finds reverse faulting PGA values are system- atically higher (significant at the 10% level) than other motions but concludes this may be due to data from outside western North America and so does not model the effect. Niazi and Bozorgnia (1991) also find evi- dence, by examining residuals, of higher ground motion from reverse faulting and lower motion from normal faulting as compared with the mean, but it is not modelled because the mechanisms of four earthquakes are unknown. Crouse et al. (1988) split data by fault mechanism and find no significant differences between thrust, normal and strike-slip. Spudich et al. (1999) find no significant difference between strike-slip and nor- mal ground motions in extensional regimes.
Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989) include a simple multiplicative factor to model difference in ground motion between reverse (and reverse-oblique) and other source mechanisms. Boore et al. (1994a) find marginal statistical significance for the difference between strike-slip and reverse-slip ground motion, which they later model as a multiplicative factor Boore et al. (1994b). Sadigh et al. (1997) also model this difference using a multiplicative factor (they include normal faulting ground motion in the strike- slip group because it was not found to be significantly different than strike-slip motion). Zhao et al. (1997) and Cousins et al. (1999) include a multiplicative factor to account for the difference between crustal reverse motion and other motions. Campbell and Bozorgnia (submitted for publication) incorporate factors to model difference between strike-slip (in- cluding normal), reverse and thrust ground motions. McVerry et al. (2000) include factors, in their crustal earthquake equation, to model differences between normal, reverse-oblique and reverse ground motions. Crouse and McGuire (1996) try a multiplicative factor, to predict the difference between reverse and strike-slip motion, in their equation but they find it is

These distances correspond to distances from a vertical fault with depth to seismogenic layer of 3 km.

not significant and the inconsistency of the result be- tween soil classes means it is difficult to attach sig- nificance to fault type.
More complex factors to model the differences in ground motion caused by different fault mechanisms have recently been included in ground motion esti- mation relations. Abrahamson and Silva (1997) include magnitude-dependent fault mechanism factors and Campbell and Bozorgnia (1994) and Campbell (1997) include distance- and magnitude-dependent factors.
Sadigh and Egan (1998) provides different equa- tions for reverse and strike-slip (including normal faulting) ground motion. This can incorporate com- plex multiplicative factors (dependent on magnitude, distance and soil category) relating ground motion associated with reverse faulting to that from strike-slip faulting but it requires much data to ensure that the predictions are realistic for all combinations of mag- nitude and distance.
Sharma (1998) does not attempt to include source mechanism factors because source mechanisms are not well defined for all earthquakes in his set of records, which come from the southern Himalayas, and including too many coefficients and a small amount of data may lead to errors.
Fig. 3 compares the estimated ratio of horizontal peak ground acceleration and response spectral ampli- tudes between reverse and strike-slip faulting earth- quakes using some recent equations derived using data from shallow crustal earthquakes. This figure shows that reverse faulting earthquakes are expected to show significantly larger response spectral ampli- tudes (up to a factor of 1.5) than strike-slip faulting earthquakes at short to intermediate periods (T V 1 s) and lower spectral amplitudes for longer periods. However there are considerable differences in the estimated ratios of reverse to strike-slip faulting ground motions between the different sets of equa- tions. These differences are due to different definitions of reverse and strike-slip faulting, different sets of earthquakes and records used and different functional forms employed.
Recent attempts have been made to model differ- ences in ground motion due to the general tectonic setting of the earthquake. Chiaruttini and Siro (1981) were the first to explicitly consider the tectonic setting (characterised by the earthquakes’ geographical loca-
tion) by developing separate equations for three differ- ent areas (Friuli, Italy; Ancona, Italy; and the rest of the Alpide belt) and also one equation which models the differences by a multiplicative factor. Fukushima and Tanaka (1990) allow different magnitude scaling for western North American earthquakes than for Japanese shocks. Youngs et al. (1997) include a multiplicative factor to predict the significant differ- ence between ground motion from interface and intra- slab subduction zone earthquakes. Zhao et al. (1997) also include a factor to account for the difference between ground motion from interface subduction zone shocks and other types of earthquake. McVerry et al. (2000) include factors, in their subduction zone equation, to predict the difference between ground shaking from interface and deep slab shocks. Si and Midorikawa (2000) include two factors to model the difference between crustal, interplate and intraplate Japanese earthquakes. A recent study on modelling differences between ground motion due to the general tectonic setting is that by Parvez et al. (2001) who find large differences in ground motions between the east- ern and western Himalayas.
Kobayashi et al. (2000) find their equation over predicts ground motion from interface earthquakes compared with intraslab motions. Crouse et al. (1988) find some differences between ground motion in different subduction zones but do not model them, partly because some differences may be because of site effects. Crouse et al. (1988) also try to find correlations between seismotectonic information (age, convergence, dip, contact width, maximum subduction depth, maximum historical earthquake, maximum rupture length, stress drop and seismic slip) and ground motion in each zone. They find weak correlations for stress drop and the maximum histor- ical earthquake but lack confidence in the results because of uncertainty in stress drop estimates.
Other studies have found that the difference between strong ground motion in different seismotec- tonic regions is not significant. Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) exclude records from different seismotectonic and geological regions and repeat their analysis and find predicted PGA is similar. No significant differ- ence is found between Guerrero (Mexico) ground motion and other Central American motion nor between subduction and shallow crustal strong ground motion by Dahle et al. (1995). Sharma (1998) neglects

 tectonic type because of a small set of records and because only small differences are expected. Atkinson (1997) checks for differences in ground motion between crustal, interface and intraslab shocks and finds no dependence on tectonic type.
Azimuthal dependence of ground motion has been investigated in three studies. Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) find that some of their PGA values show azimuthal dependence although this is not modelled because it would require more coefficients and the direction of the azimuthal effect is different from region to region. Lungu et al. (1994, 1995b) split data into separate quadrants and find ground motion estimation equations for each subset; they find azi- muthal dependence. The conclusions of this study are based on limited strong-motion data in each quadrant coming from only four earthquakes and hence special characteristics of these four earthquakes may explain the azimuthal dependence. This azimuthal depend-
ence may also be partly due to differences in travel- paths.
8.1. Characterisation of depth
Incorporation of depth through selection criteria has been discussed in Section 4, this section describes how depth is included in the ground motion estima- tion equation.
The use of distance measures which contain infor- mation on the depth of the source, i.e. hypocentral distance, rupture distance, seismogenic distance, cent- roid distance, energy centre distance, equivalent hypo- central distance or surface projection distance with focal depth (as used by Ambraseys and Bommer, 1991; Sigbjo ̈ rnsson and Baldvinsson, 1992; Ambra- seys, 1995) forces deeper earthquakes to predict smaller ground motions than shallower shocks. This is actually a path effect.

Comparison of estimated horizontal peak ground acceleration for ground motions due to subduction zone earthquakes for four equations to estimate strong ground motions for an earthquake of magnitude Mw = 7.0 and hypocentral distance of 100 km. Equation of Crouse (1991) is plotted for stiff soil site, equation of Molas and Yamazaki (1995) is plotted for site coefficient ci = 0 (average site), equation of Cousins et al. (1999) is plotted for soil site and a slab earthquake and equation of Takahashi et al. (2000) is plotted for medium soil site. Assumed that all definitions of depth used in the equations are equivalent to focal depth for this magnitude and distance.
 For sets of earthquakes with depths up to about 250 km (for example those from subduction zones) a factor which is exponentially dependent on depth is often included as well as using a distance measure which includes depth (hypocentral, centroid, energy
centre or rupture distance) (Crouse, 1991; Lungu et al., 1994, 1995b; Molas and Yamazaki, 1995; Atkin- son, 1997; Youngs et al., 1997; Zhao et al., 1997; Shabestari and Yamazaki, 1998, 2000; Cousins et al., 1999; Si and Midorikawa, 2000). Annaka and

Stiff soil sites were assumed to have an average shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m of 420 m s 􏰀 1 and hence be within category A (360 &lt; Vs,30 V 750 m s 􏰀 1) of Ambraseys et al.

Hard rock sites were assumed to have an average shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m of 800 m s 􏰀 1 and hence be within category R (Vs,30&gt;750 m s 􏰀 1) of Ambraseys et al. (1996) and category A (Vs,30&gt;800 m s 􏰀 1) of Lussou et al. (2001); for the equations of Boore et al. (1997) the actual shear-wave velocity was used and for the equations of Campbell and Bozorgnia (2002) SVFS = 0, SSR = 0 and SHR = 1 as suggested by Table 5 of Campbell and Bozorgnia (2002). A seismogenic distance of 10.4 km and a magnitude of Mw = 6.5 was used to compute the ratios for the equations of Campbell and Bozorgnia (2002); all the other ratios are independent of distance and magnitude.

Nozawa (1988), Molas and Yamazaki (1995) and Youngs et al. (1997) find it significantly increases coefficients of determination, R2, or alternatively decreases the standard deviation. Kamiyama and Yanagisawa (1986) use such a factor but employ epicentral distance. Definitions of depth used to characterise the source have been focal depth (e.g. Atkinson, 1997), depth to top of fault (e.g. Molas and Yamazaki, 1995), centroid depth (e.g. Zhao et al., 1997) and average depth of fault plane (e.g. Si and Midorikawa, 2000).
Fig. 4 compares the predicted effect of depth on horizontal peak ground acceleration for four equa- tions derived for subduction zone earthquakes in different regions of the world. This figure shows that the effect of depth can be significant (for example the equation of Cousins et al., 1999 predicts about a factor of about four increase in PGA as the depth increases from 20 to 100 km) and that the rate of increase in PGA with depth is similar in the different equations. There is a large difference, however, in the absolute size of the predicted PGAs between the different equations of over a factor of 10 differences (compare, for example, the estimate PGA using the equation of Cousins et al., 1999 and that using the equation of Crouse, 1991).
Some studies (Kawashima et al., 1986; Crouse et al., 1988) have included such factors but have found that they do not significantly reduce errors associated with the equation. Campbell (1989) includes a factor exponentially dependent on depth and alternatively one linearly dependent on depth but although predic- tion is improved, and the residual plots no longer show a dependence on focal depth, he does not recommend the use of the equations because focal depths are associated with (possibly large) errors and hence the dependence may be false. Campbell (1989) uses a set of earthquakes with a limited range of focal depths (1.8 – 24.3 km) over which focal depth depend- ence may not exist. Ambraseys (1995) also notes that focal depths are poorly determined and revises many focal depths using time between P- and S-wave arrivals. This uncertainty in focal depths means that focal depth dependence is difficult to test unless the range of depths is much greater than the errors associated with each depth estimate. Si and Midor- ikawa (2000) find that magnitude and depth are positively correlated so their associated coefficients
may be incorrectly determined, especially when using rupture distance (Fig. 5).
More complex depth dependent terms are tried by Kawashima et al. (1986), including factors which are dependent on depth and magnitude and depth and distance, but find there is no significant increase in the adjusted multiple correlation coefficient. A depth dependent anelastic attenuation factor is included and retained by Atkinson (1997).
Lungu et al. (1994, 1995b) find faster attenuation for deeper earthquakes compared with shallower shocks (this is based on attenuation rates for a few individual earthquakes) whereas Molas and Yamazaki (1995) group earthquakes by depth and find similar predictions for each group and for all the data together.
9. Characterisation of path
The distance travelled from the source to the site, d, is the parameter used in all ground motion estima- tion relations to characterise the path, although many different definitions of this distance are used (see Section 9.1).
9.1. Definitions of source-to-site distance
Joyner and Boore (1981)state that the correct distance to use in ground motion estimation relations is the distance from the origin of the actual wave, which produced the measurement of ground motion (for example PGA or SA), to the station but this is difficult to determine for past earthquakes and impos- sible to predict for future earthquakes. To overcome this difficulty, 10 different measures have been pro- posed to characterise the distance to the earthquake source:
Epicentral distance, de: distance to the epicentre of the earthquake, i.e. the distance to the horizontal projection of the rupture’s starting point.
This is the easiest distance measure to use because the epicentre is the location information given for all earthquakes.
The use of epicentral distance in hazard analysis is for small earthquakes reasonably straightforward because easily available catalogues of previous epi- centres can be used as the future sources or if line or

surface source zones are used then epicentres can be distributed on these source zones.
Hypocentral distance, dh: distance to the hypo- centre of the earthquake, i.e. the distance to the rupture’s starting point.
Like epicentres, hypocentres are reported for most earthquakes but accurate measures of focal depth are often difficult to obtain unless there is a good distri- bution of stations with distance from the source (Gubbins, 1990). Most damaging earthquakes occur within a shallow region of the crust (about the top 30 km) and hence de and dh become equal at intermediate and large distances.
Since focal depth becomes less important as the size of the earthquake increases (because the earth- quake ruptures the entire seismogenic layer) and because focal depths of small earthquakes, for which depth is important, are likely to be associated with large errors, the use of hypocentral distance in ground motion estimation relations is unlikely to decrease the standard deviation of the final equation. This conclu- sion is only valid for shallow crustal earthquakes.
The use of hypocentral distance in ground motion estimation relations also means that further informa- tion needs to be gathered, compared with distance measures that do not include depth, during hazard assessment. However, available catalogues of pre- vious earthquakes usually contain depth information.
Rupture centroid distance, dc: distance to the centroid of the rupture.
This distance measure requires an estimate of the dimensions of the rupture plane so that the centroid can be defined; it can be difficult to define this plane. However, because it is measured to a point source uncertainties in defining the exact location of the rupture plane will have less of an effect on rupture centroid distances than for line or surface measures.
Centre-of-energy-release distance, dE: distance to a point on the fault rupture where energy considered to be concentrated (Crouse et al., 1988; Crouse, 1991).
This distance is similar to rupture centroid dis- tance.
Surface projection distance (also called Joyner – Boore or fault distance), df: distance to the surface projection of the rupture plane of the fault (Joyner and Boore, 1981); for a point within the projection df = 0.
For line or surface distances (EHD, D, df, df,h, dr and ds) and also the point distances dc and dE the location of the rupture plane must be known. The uncertainties and problems involved in finding rupture planes are discussed by workers developing relation- ships between magnitude and gross characteristics of faulting such as rupture length (e.g. Bonilla et al., 1984; Wells and Coppersmith, 1994). Techniques for defining the location of the probable rupture plane are discussed in Douglas (2001b).
Surface projection distances can have large uncertainties (up to 20 km for certain earthquakes and stations) because there are no published studies on the rupture plane or because there are several and no obvious way of deciding which is best. The errors in surface projection distances could be larger for earthquakes occurring during a sequence of similar sized shocks when aftershocks and geodetic data are likely to be difficult to use. Such earth- quakes will probably have M &lt; 6 and hence rupture lengths of around 10 km, so epicentral distance will be more reliable than surface projection distance. The current practice of quoting surface projection distances to one decimal place should not be taken as meaning that the distances are accurately known to 0.1 km.
Surface projection distance with focal depth, df,h: distance to the projection of the rupture on a plane at the focal depth.
The horizontal distance part of surface projection distance with focal depth are obviously associated with the same uncertainty as surface projection distance and errors in focal depths have already been discussed.
Rupture distance (also called source or fault distance), dr: distance to rupture surface.
Estimates of this distance requires the same infor- mation as for df together with the depth of rupture which like focal depth is difficult to obtain for many earthquakes. The vertical resolution of aftershock locations can be poor and so it is difficult to define the dip of the fault.
For future earthquakes, rupture distance can be estimated using mapped faults although it requires that the dip and depth of the faults are known.
Seismogenic distance, ds: distance to seismo- genic rupture surface, assumes that the near-surface rupture in sediments is non-seismogenic (Campbell, 1997).

Marone and Scholz (1998) find that well-devel- oped faults, i.e. faults that have undergone significant net displacement and as a result contain thick zones of wear material (gouge), display an absence of seismic- ity in about the top 3 km. Therefore such faults may exhibit stable slip within this zone and unstable slip below this depth where the gouge becomes consoli- dated. On the other hand poorly developed faults, i.e. faults with little or no net displacement and hence no appreciable gouge zone, display seismic failure throughout the upper zone. Seismogenic distance is measured to the part of fault where unstable slip occurs.
Campbell (1997) believes that seismogenic dis- tance can be ‘reliably and easily determined for most significant earthquakes’ but, in fact, it has the same difficulties in its determination as rupture distance, which can be large, plus the requirement of defining depth to the seismogenic layer.
There will be little difference between rupture and seismogenic distance if rupture distances are defined to a rupture plane which is defined by: aftershock distribution, because aftershocks do not occur in stable slip zones; or fault slip inversion, which will define the part of the rupture plane where most slip occurred which correlates with the unstable zone (e.g. Archuleta, 1984; Marone and Scholz, 1998). Seismogenic distances are only likely to be signifi- cantly different to rupture distances for earthquakes with surface rupture which if it occurred for a well- developed fault, such as the Imperial Valley fault, would be considered to be the result of unstable slip at depth and not the stable slip in the gouge near the surface.
Campbell (1997) provides an equation for estimat- ing the minimum seismogenic distance possible given Mw, rupture width, dip of rupture, depth to top of seismogenic zone and depth to bottom of seismogenic zone for a future earthquake, if no other information is available. However, the use of this equation in hazard assessment means that any reduction in uncertainty brought about by the use of seismogenic distance, compared with other distance measures, will be rein- troduced.
Elliptical distance D or average site to rupture end distance, ASRED: mean of the distances to the extremities of the fault surface rupture (Bureau, 1978; Zhou et al., 1989), if no surface rupture occurred then
the projection of the top of the rupture should be used.
No measurements of the width or depth of rupture are needed so elliptical distance has less uncertainty than either surface projection, rupture or seismogenic distances.
One consequence of using elliptical distance is that it automatically models near-field flattening of the attenuation curves without needing an equiva- lent depth term. For large magnitudes this flat area increases in size and elliptical distance use forces a nonlinear increase in acceleration with increase in magnitude. The consequence of using this distance is that the magnitude dependent terms included in the decay part of ground motion estimation equa- tions by some authors (e.g. Campbell, 1981) do not need to be included separately (Douglas, 2001b).
As elliptical distance requires only the ends of a fault to be located, it is easier to estimate for future earthquakes occurring along defined surface faults.
Equivalent hypocentral distance, EHD: dis-
tance from a virtual point source that provides
the same energy to the site as does a finite-size
fault (Ohno et al., 1993). Defined by: 1=EHD2 1⁄4
Pn M2 X􏰀2=Pn M2 , where n is the number of i1⁄41 0;i i i1⁄41 0;i
segments on the rupture plane, M0,i is the seismic moment density on the ith segment and Xi is the distance between ith segment and site.
It includes the effects of fault size, fault geometry and inhomogeneous slip distribution (Ohno et al., 1993). Ohno et al. (1996), Kawano et al. (2000) and Si and Midorikawa (2000) use EHD to derive their ground motion estimation equations.
To calculate EHD reliably requires much more information about an earthquake than other distance metrics used in ground motion estimation equations, namely it needs the distribution of displacement on the fault plane (assuming that the source time function is the same for all small segments on the fault plane) (Ohno et al., 1993). For large (Mk6.5), well recorded earthquakes maps of such distributions are being increasingly produced and published although for the same earthquake there are occasionally many different interpretations of the rupture for the same earthquake.

linearly increasing moment release along a horizontal line source.
EHD for faults with linearly increasing moment release predicts slower decay of ground motion at the end where most moment is released compared with the end where the moment release is least (Fig. 6). As distance from the fault increases the contours of equal EHD for both uniform and linearly increas- ing ground motion become most circular and hence the decay of ground motion is modelled as if the energy was released from a point source. For uni- form moment release the point source is at the centre of the fault and for linearly increasing moment it is near the end of the fault where most of the moment was released. This compares with surface projection distance and rupture distance where the contours of equal distance never become circular (see Fig. 8) and so there is not one point source from which all the energy is assumed to be radiated.
Reliable determination of the fault slip that oc- curred during an earthquake, which is required for calculation of EHD, needs a large number of near- field accelerograms. Therefore it can only be esti-
mated where there is a high density of accelero- graphs, such as California, Japan and Taiwan. Even when such data does exists, the determined fault slip is still not precisely defined as can be demonstrated by comparing some of the different inversions of fault slip for the Imperial Valley earthquake (15/10/ 1979). The earthquake has been, and continues to be, intensely studied because of the wealth of high- quality near-field strong-motion data and there have been many different fault slip determinations made. Fig. 7 shows a comparison of six of these inver- sions. From Fig. 7 it can be seen that although there are similarities between the inversions, such as the area of large slip (about 2 m) in the centre of the fault, there are also significant differences. These differences in slip translate into differences in the EHDs for the stations which recorded the earth- quake.
When no inversions of the fault slip have been made, either uniform slip along the entire fault is assumed or hypocentral distance is used such as was done by Ohno et al. (1996) for some small magnitude earthquakes and for earthquakes with limited near- source recordings.
As short period ground motions (including PGA) is caused by local variations in the fault slip (Hanks and Johnson, 1976; McGarr, 1981; Boatwright and Boore, 1982; McGarr, 1982), EHD is unlikely to improve the modelling of such motions as it is an average of the moment release over the entire fault which does not have a large effect on short period motions. Therefore any possible improvement in modelling the variation due to distance by using EHD is probably likely to be for long period ground motions which are more dependent on the moment release over the entire fault. Ohno et al. (1996) and Si and Midorikawa (2000) have not found signifi- cantly lower standard deviations by using EHD rather than simpler distance metrics.
EHD is obviously much more difficult to calculate than the more common distance measures such as epicentral, hypocentral, surface projection or rupture distance.
At present the estimation of the pattern of fault slip in future earthquakes is impossible therefore the use of EHD in hazard analysis is also impossible except if uniform or simple slip patterns (see Fig. 6) are assumed.

For all these reasons, although EHD, compared with simpler distance metrics, is a more physically based distance metric and possibly has the ability to more adequately model the variations in long period ground motions, its use in ground motion estimation relations will not significantly reduce the associated uncertainty.
Idriss (1978) splits distance measurements into two groups: those measured to a point (de, dh, dc and dE) and those measured to a line or surface (df, df,h, dr, ds, D and EHD). Some of these distance measures obey inequalities: df V dr V ds (df = dr for vertical ruptures which reach the surface and for points on the foot wall of ruptures which reach the surface) and df V de V D. At large distances from the source all measures become almost equal, thus at great distances which is used is unimportant.
Fig. 8 shows the contours of equal distance using the epicentral, surface projection, rupture and ellipti- cal distances from a fault of length 50 km, width 20 km, dip 30j which reached the surface, with the hypocentre at the bottom of the north eastern corner of the rupture. Only these four different distances are plotted because hypocentral, surface projection with focal depth and seismogenic distances all have similar characteristics to those contours for epicentral, surface projection and rupture distance respectively. Fig. 8 shows the different assumptions, of how ground motion attenuates with distance, made when different distance metrics are used.
The most common form of decay term is a power law decay (which corresponds to geometric decay due to the spreading of waves from a source) using a modified distance, R, therefore the decay term is

R 􏰀 a. Distance is often modified through the addition
of a constant, i.e. R = d + b (e.g. Esteva, 1970), or by
assuming that the source is at some depth, h, and then pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
using the slant distance, R 1⁄4 d2 þ h2 (e.g. Joyner
and Boore, 1981). The actual distance, d, is not
usually used, except when hypocentral distance (e.g.
Caillot and Bard, 1993) or mainly far-field data (e.g.
Singh et al., 1987) is used, because for small d
unrealistically high values of ground motion are pre-
dicted. The form R = d + b does not correspond to a
physical situation (even though Donovan and Born-
stein, 1978 suggest it does), unlike the form R 1⁄4 pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
d2 þ h2, and hence relating the decay rate, a, found
using this form to the real decay rate of different types
of seismic waves is not correct. Often the calculated
decay rate using R=d+b as opposed to R1⁄4 pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
d2 þ h2 is greater, for example McCann and Echez- wia (1984) use one set of PGA values and fit both forms of distance dependence and find using the first form (with b = 25 km assigned) a = 􏰀 1.915 whereas using the second form (with h = 3.852 km found through regression) a = 􏰀 0.913. Only in the far field, dHb, does (d + b) 􏰀 a actually give a decay rate a against d and hence only the decay rates where there is much data (usually d f b) should be compared.
The power, a, which controls the decay rate is
either fixed or found during the regression. Joyner and
Boore (1981) constrain a to unity because this is the
decay rate for body waves which they assume cause
the peak ground acceleration; this choice of a has
been followed by many other authors (e.g. Ambraseys
and Bommer, 1991; Munson and Thurber, 1997).
Garcia-Fernandez and Canas (1995) constrain a to
1/2 because they assume their peak acceleration is
associated with Lg waves. Ambraseys and Bommer
(1991) also use a = 0.83 because they assume PGA is
associated with the Airy phase. Campbell (1981)
constrains a to 1.75 which he says is representative
of far-field decay of PGA, although note this is for
R=d+b and hence it may be larger than if R1⁄4 pffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
d2 þ h2 was used. Kamiyama et al. (1992) and Kamiyama (1995) constrain the decay rate to 􏰀 1.64 using results from other studies. Often though a is found during the regression which is better, since the equation would fit the data more closely, but requires a well distributed set of data in terms of distance and not too many other coefficients to find. Joyner and Boore (1983) state that they constrain a to 1 in Joyner
and Boore (1981) because they believe their data did not permit a physically meaningful, simultaneous determination of a spreading coefficient and a coef- ficient of anelastic attenuation. If the data is insuffi- cient then nonphysical coefficients can be found which although apparently match the data well, pre- dict unrealistic ground motions at the edges of the data space.
Campbell (1981) introduces the concept of magni- tude dependent b or h, which means that the part of the attenuation curve (roughly the near field) with smaller decay rate than that in the far field is not constant for all sizes of earthquakes. This is known as distance saturation. Usually b and h are of the form A exp(BM), where M is the magnitude, because this makes the flattened region of the curve proportional to the size of the fault rupture zone which has been found to be exponentially dependent on magnitude (e.g. Ambraseys and Jackson, 1998). Kamiyama et al. (1992) and Kamiyama (1995) give a model where PGA is completely independent of distance within a zone, which is exponentially dependent on magnitude. Joyner and Boore (1981), Sabetta and Pugliese (1987), Boore et al. (1994a) and Ambraseys (1995) find no evidence for magnitude dependent h for their data and distance definition (distance to surface pro- jection of rupture), although Sabetta and Pugliese (1987) state that their experiment is not conclusive due to the distribution of data (there are only a few near-field records from large magnitude earthquakes in their set of records). Joyner and Boore (1981) prefer a magnitude independent h because fewer coefficients need to be found.
Campbell (1997) models different decay for thrust(-oblique) and reverse(-oblique) faults than that for other source mechanisms (strike-slip and normal). This effect must be due to different seismic waves being predominant in accelerograms from earthquakes with different source mechanisms because the travel path is independent of the source mechanism.
Trifunac and Lee (1989) and Lee (1993) use an attenuation term that is dependent on focal depth, magnitude and correlation radius of source function (which can be approximated by shear-wave velocity).
Campbell (1997), Youngs et al. (1997) and Camp- bell and Bozorgnia (submitted for publication) model different decay rates for sites in different soil catego- ries. This idea, although it may be supported by their

data, only has a physical meaning (different local site amplifications) as a site effect and not as a path effect because although locally the soil may be known this does not mean such geology is constant along the travel path. Gaull (1988) and Yamabe and Kanai (1988) present models with magnitude dependent decay rates even in the far field. In the far field, all earthquakes are seen by the site as point sources and hence the far-field decay rate should be independent of magnitude.
Recorded strong ground motion is composed of many types of seismic waves (P, S, Lg and surface waves). These waves attenuate with individual rates, therefore different waves dominate at different dis- tances, making the decay of peak ground motion complex. Trifunac and Brady (1975, 1976) and Tri- funac (1976) model this by using the distance cali- bration function used for the calculation of ML, derived by Richter (1958), which has a change of slope at d=75 km because for d&lt;75 km body waves predominate, with decay f d 􏰀 1, where as for d&gt;75 km surface waves predominate, with decay f d 􏰀 1/2. Dahle et al. (1990a,b) also incorporate a change of slope into their decay term (although it is not a smooth transition from one decay rate to another) which models the change from spherical spreading, i.e. d 􏰀 1, of S waves to cylindrical spreading, i.e. d 􏰀 5/6, of Lg waves at 100 km, although they note that the point where the slope changes depends on crustal structure and focal depth. Theoretical consideration of the importance of crustal structure on the rate of decay of seismic waves is contained within, for example, Burger et al. (1987) and Suhadolc and Chiaruttini (1987). McCann and Echezwia (1984) consider an expression of the near-field response of an elastic whole space which incorporates the first and second order geometrical spreading terms through an expres- sion, (A/d2 + B/d)C, which allows the peak ground motions to come from the combined effect of two different types of wave.
Joyner and Boore (1981) introduce a term, of form exp kR, to model anelastic decay. This has been adopted by a number of subsequent authors (e.g. Ambraseys and Bommer, 1991; Sigbjo ̈rnsson and Baldvinsson, 1992) although often the geometrical decay power, a, is fixed at unity so that a realistic, i.e. negative, anelastic coefficient is found. If a is not fixed then k is often found to be positive (e.g.
Ambraseys et al., 1996), which predicts increasing ground motion for increasing distance at large dis- tances.
Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989) only include an anelastic term for interplate earthquakes. Atkinson (1997) includes a depth dependent anelastic decay term. Cousins et al. (1999) and McVerry et al. (2000) include a term to account for the higher anelastic decay due to the waves travelling through a volcanic region. Lee (1995) includes an anelastic decay term, which becomes the only decay term for distances greater than a distance dependent on focal depth, magnitude and correlation radius of source function. Trifunac (1976) states that because the representative frequency of peak amplitudes varies with distance and because the relative digitization noise also changes with distance, it is difficult to include an anelastic decay term.
Abrahamson and Silva (1997) include a term, which is dependent on distance, for sites on the hanging wall of a fault rupture. Their term probably accounts for a site on the hanging wall seeing more of the rupture plane than a site on the foot wall but their complicated form for this term may not be justified by their limited amount of data.
Donovan and Bornstein (1978) use a complicated distance dependence, involving geometrical decay but also factors which model magnitude and distance- dependent decay. Such a form of distance dependence, although it may be supported by their data, is unneces- sarily complex, when it does not reduce the uncer- tainty associated with ground motion prediction, especially because they fit their non-linear equation, containing six coefficients, to only 59 records from 10 earthquakes.
Bolt and Abrahamson (1982) use a form of distance dependence which does not have a physical basis, i.e. they do not try to estimate geometrical decay or anelastic decay coefficients (Bolt and Abrahamson, 1983). Bolt and Abrahamson (1983) state the reason for their choice was to provide a form that will predict accelerations validly, particularly near the source.
10. Characterisation of site
Local site conditions at an accelerograph station can dramatically affect the strong ground motion

recorded, for example Schenk (1984) relates the great variability in recorded ground motions up to 30 km to different site conditions. Therefore attempts are made in most ground motion estimation relations to model the effect of different near-surface ground conditions on strong motion. Some publications (e.g. Lungu et al., 1995b) however, use data from a wide variety of sites with different properties (ranging from stiff soil to very soft soil sites) and do not try to model or examine any differences. Equations that do not examine or model differences in site response are of limited value, especially when the equations are for intermediate- and long-period spec- tral ordinates, which can be significantly affected by local site conditions.
Data selection criteria, which seek to limit the accelerograms used to those recorded at stations with similar local site conditions, are the simplest techni- ques which have been employed. Esteva (1970), Faccioli (1978), Ohsaki et al. (1980b), Campbell (1989), Dahle et al. (1990b), Mohammadioun (1994a) and Xiang and Gao (1994) restrict their data to those from sites comparable to stiff clay or compact conglomerate, soft soil sites, bedrock sites, deep soil (depth greater than 10 m) sites, rock sites, rock sites with Vs z 750 ms and basement rock sites respectively. Some studies do not select records from a homogeneous set of sites but only exclude those which are affected by significant soil amplification or non-linearity (usually soft soil sites) (e.g. McGuire, 1977; Campbell, 1981; Ohno et al., 1996; Sadigh et al., 1997; McVerry et al., 2000; Si and Midorikawa, 2000). Other studies (Iwasaki et al., 1980; Ohsaki et al., 1980a; Chiaruttini and Siro, 1981; Kawashima et al., 1986; Huo and Hu, 1991; Caillot and Bard, 1993; Crouse and McGuire, 1996; Sadigh et al., 1997) include data from different site categories but perform the regression on subsets of records with the same site classification. The advantage of this method is that non-linear soil behaviour is implicitly included, because the magnitude and dis- tance scaling for each site category is independent of that for the other categories. Unless there are a lot of records and the distributions within each class are similar, differences between the predicted ground motion on different types of sites may not be significant and may be simply due to the lack of comparable data.
Two studies have taken this idea to its extreme and only used records from a single station (Denham and Small, 1971; Singh et al., 1987). Niazi and Bozorgnia (1991) use records from the SMART-1 array, where the stations have essentially identical site conditions, but find that there is still much uncertainty. Such studies are of limited use for design because struc- tures will not be built on the exact location of the instrument nor it is easy to decide whether another location has similar site conditions to the accele- rograph station. However, such studies are of use for research about local site effects and also about the causes and properties of the scatter associated with equations for the estimation of strong ground motions.
The most commonly used technique to incorpo- rate site effects into a ground motion estimation relation is to use multiplicative factors between ground motion at one type of site and that at another. Trifunac (1976) introduces this method; he uses three site categories and the multiplicative factor between basement rock and intermediate type rock is forced to be half the multiplicative factor between solid hard basement rock and alluvium sites thus limiting the generality of the method. The number of multi- plicative factors used is usually one less than the number of site categories used, thus allowing differ- ent scalings amongst the site categories (e.g. Boore et al., 1993; Lawson and Krawinkler, 1994; Ambra- seys et al., 1996; Sabetta and Pugliese, 1996; Chap- man, 1999). Lee (1995) classifies stations into three geological site classes and two local soil classes, although the difference between geological and local scales is not clear, so there are six categories in total but only three factors. All the data is used to derive the magnitude and distance scaling, making the coefficients more robust, and removing bias from the amplification factors between the different site classes due to the distribution of the data. Possible non-linear behaviour though cannot be modelled by these factors because they are equal throughout the dataspace. A combination of this method with the more general method explained above was used by Crouse and McGuire (1996), who compute multi- plicative factors for two of their four soil categories because of the lack of data within the two categories. Caillot and Bard (1993) initially derive equations for each of their two site category subsets separately but

find that the magnitude and distance coefficients of the two sets of equations are not significantly differ- ent so they employ a simple multiplicative factor. This shows that non-linear effects are probably not that important, although Caillot and Bard (1993) use a set of records with many weak motion time- histories so the non-linear effects may be masked.
Some studies have insufficient data to derive adequate site category multiplicative factors so they adopt multiplicative factors from previous studies (e.g. Atkinson, 1997; Spudich et al., 1999). If the site categories used in the two studies are similar enough then this is a valid procedure because true site coefficients should only depend on local site condi- tions at the stations.
Multiplicative factors between ground motion on different types of site are not always modelled as the same throughout the data space. McGuire (1978) attempts to include a distance dependent multiplica- tive factor but it is not statistically significant; a magnitude dependent factor, although statistically significant, does not reduce scatter and McGuire (1978) thinks it may be biased due to lack of rock records so it is not adopted. Campbell (1997) incor- porates distance dependent site factors and Cousins et al. (1999), McVerry et al. (2000) and Campbell and Bozorgnia (submitted for publication) include distance and magnitude-dependent site factors. Although Youngs et al. (1997) develop two separate equations for deep soil and rock sites they employ a joint regression method, because there is not enough data to apply regression to the individual subsets. Non-linear soil behaviour is explicitly accounted for in Abrahamson and Silva (1997) through the use of a factor which includes the predicted PGA on rock; a factor also included by McVerry et al. (2000) although they adopted the coefficients of Abraham- son and Silva (1997) because they have too few records to give realistic estimates of the coefficients. This problem highlights the main disadvantage of using such complicated factors, namely that a large, well distributed set of records is required to find robust estimates of coefficients in a non-linear equa- tion.
Choices of site categories into which a station is placed is controlled by the quality of available site information. Complex classifications cannot be used, even if desired, unless there is adequate data for all
the sites used Spudich et al. (1999). Thus early studies (e.g. McGuire, 1978; Joyner and Boore, 1981) and some recent studies (e.g. Zhao et al., 1997; Spudich et al., 1999) simply use a binary classification of soil (or alluvium) and rock. Usually a site is classified as soil (or alluvium) if it has soil of more than between 4 (Joyner and Boore, 1981) and 20 m (Abrahamson and Silva, 1997) thick, because a shallow soil layer is not thought to greatly affect the ground motion. Some studies though have found that shallow soil sites have significantly higher ground motions than rock or stiff soil sites and that rock and deep soil sites have similar ground motion (Campbell, 1981, 1989; Sabetta and Pugliese, 1987) although this is for PGA (a high frequency param- eter) which is less affected by local site conditions. Ambraseys and Bommer (1991) attribute the appa- rent small dependence of horizontal PGA on site classification to the lack of available information which compelled them to use a simple binary sys- tem. As more site information on strong-motion stations has become available, the number of site classes used has grown, so that there are three or more categories of increasing stiffness (roughly increasing shear-wave velocity) (e.g. Trifunac, 1976; Kawashima et al., 1986; Fukushima and Tanaka, 1990; Lawson and Krawinkler, 1994; Camp- bell, 1997; Chapman, 1999; Kobayashi et al., 2000). Some studies define the boundaries of the categories in terms of shear-wave velocity (e.g. Boore et al., 1993; Ambraseys et al., 1996) but in fact there are no shear-wave velocity measurements for many of the stations they use, so a rough classification is made. Due to the difficulty of finding site informa- tion, Theodulidis and Papazachos (1992) examined the PGV/PGA ratio for some of their Alaskan sites to decide whether they were rock or soil, which is based on empirical formulae which find differences in this ratio due to the local site conditions. There is some uncertainty in such formulae, due partly to the variability of ground motion and partly to the accel- erogram correction method used to find PGV and hence classification based on PGV/PGA is unreli- able. Sadigh and Egan (1998) show that PGV/PGA depends on magnitude, distance and source mecha- nism and not just site conditions and so care is needed in interpreting PGV/PGA ratios in terms of site conditions. However, Decanini et al. (2000)

show that useful information on site conditions can be obtained from PGV/PGA and so it is a useful technique if no measured wave velocities are avail- able. In an attempt to reduce the subjectivity of classifying Greek stations into rock or alluvium cate- gories Theodulidis and Papazachos (1992) use the opinion of seven specialists and then use the average classification; this is a time-consuming process.
Examination of residuals for sites with different soil categories is a useful method for sets of records where site information is not complete, and hence cannot be included explicitly within the equation. This type of analysis was performed by Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989).
To overcome the subjectivity of soil categories some studies have used directly measured properties of the ground beneath the accelerograph station. The most commonly used measurement is the near-sur- face shear-wave velocity, Vs. Blume (1977) finds that the site impendence, qVs (where q is the density of the ground which is approximately a constant), is the best measure of site condition and he uses it to derive site factors for his equation although the paper is not entirely clear how this is done. Joyner and Fumal (1984) use the average shear-wave velocity to one-quarter the wavelength of waves of period of concern (although often these shear-wave velocities are extrapolated using geological data); the basis of this choice is energy conservation along ray tubes. Shear-wave velocity is usually only measured down to shallow depths so 30 m is often used as the reference depth to which to compute the average shear-wave velocity, although Boore et al. (1994a) state that ideally they would like to use depth to one quarter wavelength. Boore et al. (1994a) and Ambra- seys (1995) include site factors based on average shear-wave velocity to 30 m in their equations. Unlike other formulations to incorporate site condi- tions into ground motion estimation relations, directly using shear-wave velocity has the advantage of being physically based so the coefficients can be examined to check that they are reasonable. Also it is better because there is no need for subjective categories Ambraseys (1995). This has two advan- tages: firstly, no decisions need to be made about the categories to use or which category a particular station is in and secondly, when the equation is used for design the shear-wave velocity at the site can be
measured and used directly in the formula, removing the need for more subjective judgement on the part of the designer who does not know exactly how site classifications were originally done. The major prob- lem with using Vs is that there are no published measurements at most strong-motion stations, espe- cially those outside California or Japan (Ambraseys, 1995; Spudich et al., 1999). Different choices of the reference depth to compute the average Vs can lead to different results (Ambraseys, 1995) so subjectivity is not completely removed although Boore et al. (1994a) believe one-quarter wavelength depth is the best to use but for long periods this is hundreds of metres for which the data is currently unavailable. Another disadvantage of this method is that surface waves could be important (Joyner and Fumal, 1984; Boore et al., 1994a), especially for long periods, and their amplifications are not modelled by using Vs directly in the equation like it is at present (Joyner and Fumal, 1984). Also it does not model the effect of the thickness of attenuating material (Boore et al., 1994a) or resonance effects (Joyner and Fumal, 1984).
Some studies have used site factors based on other measurements which can possibly overcome some of the disadvantages of shear-wave velocity, although not all have a physical basis. Joyner and Fumal (1984) include site factors based on Vs and depth to under- lying rock, H, and find correlation for long periods but no correlation for short periods although they state it is inappropriate to use depth to rock at present because the San Fernando strong-motion data does not show any significant correlation. Trifunac (1980) and Tri- funac and Lee (1989) include a multiplicative factor which is exponentially dependent on the depth of sedimentary deposit although Trifunac and Lee (1989) note that this is not always known at every location so they also provide an equation using simple site categories. A combination of depth to rock and site categories is employed by Lee (1993) and Camp- bell (1997) although Campbell (1997) uses a complex depth scaling factor. Combinations of depth to rock and site categories are not the most efficient site parameters because they are not strictly independent, for example if a site is classified as rock then the depth to rock must be zero. This correlation could cause problems when coefficients of both these factors are sought.

A single parameter which is a rough combination of shear-wave velocity and depth to bedrock is the natural period of the site, T, which for a single layer equals 4H/Vs. The need to include a term reflecting explicitly local amplification dependent on natural period of the soil is noted by Benito et al. (1992) because they find little correlation between simple soil categories and ground motion. A factor exponentially dependent on natural period is included by Tong and Katayama (1988) and Sun and Peng (1993), although Tong and Katayama (1988) find that it has little effect on estimation. Using natural period explicitly rather than depth to rock and shear-wave velocity reduces generality because if both H and Vs are included there are more coefficients to be determined, allowing modelling of attenuation effects through the soil layer (which depends on depth) and also impedance (which depends on shear-wave velocity). Also the natural period of the site is less available for strong-motion recording sites than is shear-wave velocity and hence it is easier to use shear-wave velocity than natural period of the site.
The most site specific procedure is to use indi- vidual coefficients for each station. This idea was introduced by Kamiyama and Yanagisawa (1986) (although Kobayashi and Midorikawa, 1982 devel- oped a method which is similar) and has since been adopted in many Japanese studies (Kamiyama et al., 1992; Fukushima et al., 1995; Molas and Yamazaki, 1995; Shabestari and Yamazaki, 1998; Kawano et al., 2000; Shabestari and Yamazaki, 2000). Its two advantages are that no site information is required about the stations included in the set of records, hence eliminating subjective soil categories or the need to measure shear-wave velocity or similar quantities, and all site effects should be modelled through the use of automatically derived transfer functions. To use this method, a large number of records are required for each station, hence its use in Japan where there is an abundance of data, otherwise the station coefficients are not adequately determined. For example, if each station recorded only one earthquake then the standard deviation of the ground motion estimation equation would be zero because the individual site coefficients would equal the residuals from the regression without any site factors. This though would not be correct because the derived coefficients cannot be related
to site response but could be due to either source, path or site effects. A number of records at each station are required, with different source and path conditions, before the site coefficients tend to the true values, which gives the correct transfer function for each site. Kamiyama and Yanagisawa (1986) find a good agreement between the site coefficients (transformed to amplification spectra) and the ampli- fication spectra predicted using the shear-wave velocity profiles of the stations. Molas and Yama- zaki (1995) find weak correlation between station coefficients and soil categories although there is much scatter. Unless the individual site coefficients can be related to the theoretical transfer function at each station or to some other feature of the site, ground motion estimation relations including these individual factors are impossible to use for the prediction of ground motion at a site which is not within the original set of records. Even if a relation could be found between site characteristics and the coefficients, the use of such equations in seismic hazard analysis, where many sites are considered, would require detailed information on all those under investigation.
The most computational intensive method for including local site effects within an ground motion estimation study is to convert all the recorded time- histories from sites with a variety of properties to time-histories which would have been recorded on a site with given properties. This procedure was adop- ted by Annaka and Nozawa (1988), who use 1D propagation theory to transform records from sites with Vs &lt; 300 m s 􏰀 1 to records from sites with Vs&gt;300 m s 􏰀 1, and Kawano et al. (2000), who strip off the effects of the uppermost layers of ground under a station to get a record which comes from a site with 0.5 VVs V 2.7 km 􏰀 1. Altering the recorded time-his- tory in this way could lead to increased uncertainty because the ground motion is not simply affected by the ground directly under the station (1D effect) but by the ground within an undefined area (2D and 3D effects).
No published ground motion estimation relation considers topographical effects except those which exclude records believed to be affected by topography, see Section 4, and Zhao et al. (1997) who include in their rock category records from stations where topo- graphic effects are expected.

Fig. 5 compares the estimated ratio of horizontal peak ground acceleration and response spectral amplitudes between soft soil sites and hard rock sites and between stiff soil sites and hard rock sites using some recent equations. This figure shows that soil sites are expected to show significantly larger response spectral amplitudes (up to a factor of 2.5) than rock sites at almost all periods of engineering interest with the maximum ratio occurring around T = 1 s. However there are considerable differences in the estimated ratios of soil and rock ground motions between the different sets of equations. Compare, for example, the estimated ratios using the equations of Campbell and Bozorgnia (submit- ted for publication), which predict large ratios (up to a factor of 2.5 for soft and stiff soil), and those of Lussou et al. (2001), which predict much smaller ratios (up to a factor of 1.3 for stiff soil and 1.6 for soft soil). These differences are due to different site classifications, different sets of sites and records used and different functional forms employed.
11. Analysis techniques
The majority of ground motion estimation studies use the ordinary least squares method (or an unspeci- fied procedure) to derive the coefficients of their equation. However, more complex procedures have been developed to overcome problems encountered due to the inhomogeneity, in terms of independent parameters, of most strong-motion sets. These inho- mogeneities are listed below.
􏰂 In most strong-motion sets, unless they are specially selected, there is a strong correlation between magnitude and distance of the records, because larger earthquakes can be detected at greater distances than smaller earthquakes.
􏰂 There is an abundance of accelerograms from large distances (from between about 50 and 200 km) and there still is a lack of near-field data from large earthquakes which are most important for seismic design.
􏰂 Some earthquakes (for example San Fernando) occur within a region with a large number of accelerographs so there are many available records.
Regression techniques have been developed to counteract the ill effect on the estimated coefficients (and hence predictions) caused by each of these characteristics.
Donovan (1973) was the first to find that correla- tion between magnitude and distance leads to changes in the derived coefficients. The regression method most often used to reduce the effect of magnitude and distance correlation is the two-stage technique introduced by Joyner and Boore (1981). In this method, the distance dependent coefficients are derived first, using individual amplitude scaling fac- tors for each earthquake. In the second stage the magnitude-dependent coefficients are derived by fit- ting a curve to these amplitude-scaling factors. Fukushima and Tanaka (1990) conduct simple numerical experiments to show that for sets with a strong correlation between magnitude and distance the distance dependence is reduced, when ordinary least squares is used, compared with the decay associated with an individual earthquake. They find the two-stage method yields distance coefficients similar to those associated with individual earth- quakes. This usefulness of the two-stage method has also been demonstrated by Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989), Fukushima et al. (1995), Molas and Yamazaki (1995) and Sharma (1998, 2000) for their highly correlated (correlation coefficients up to 0.63) magnitude and distance values. Sabetta and Pugliese (1987, 1996), Boore et al. (1994a), Ambra- seys (1995) and Ambraseys et al. (1996) have found that one-stage and two-stage methods yield similar predictions, especially at intermediate distances where there is most of the data. Ambraseys and Bommer (1991) prefer a one-stage method because more than half the earthquakes in their set of records were only recorded by one instrument and in the second stage these are excluded from the calculation of the magnitude dependence, thereby omitting a large proportion of their data from the regression. Spudich et al. (1999) also use a one-stage method because two-stage methods underestimate the earth- quake-to-earthquake component of variation for sets of records like theirs with many singly recorded earthquakes. Caillot and Bard (1993) state that the two-stage method may be misleading because for some spectral periods it does not reduce the variance; they also find significant changes in predictions

between one- and two-stage methods. A similar technique is applied by Orphal and Lahoud (1974), who use data from the well-recorded San Fernando earthquake to find the distance dependent coeffi- cient and then the rest of the data, from other less well-recorded earthquakes, to define the magnitude scaling. Gaull (1988) applied a variation of this method. This method assumes that the distance decay is the same for all earthquakes; an assump- tion which is not necessarily justified. McCue et al. (1988) implemented the reverse of this idea, firstly finding the magnitude dependence by exam- ining PGA for many events recorded at the same distance and then using all data to find the distance dependence.
A more complex procedure to overcome the effect of a strong correlation between magnitude and dis- tance (correlation coefficient 0.84) was developed by Tong and Katayama (1988). It is based on a ‘eliabil- ity’ parameter for each earthquake, it is the product of the number of records from that earthquake and the coefficient of determination of a regression equation, derived for each earthquake individually, which esti- mates the geometrical decay rate. Using earthquakes with ‘reliability’ values greater than unity they find that a weighted average, using the ‘reliability’ values, leads to a distance dependence coefficient which is not affected by the correlation between magnitude and distance.
A method was introduced by Trifunac (1976), where the set of records is split up into 24 different magnitude, site and component (horizontal or verti- cal) intervals. The magnitude, site, component and confidence interval dependent coefficients are calcu- lated using one PGA value from each interval. This method reduces the possible bias in the coefficients due to a large number of records with similar magni- tudes. Another procedure to reduce this bias was used by Blume (1980). The data is divided into distance dependent bands and within each band a regression equation dependent on magnitude is found which is used to calculate the predicted ground motion at a single point within the interval. Each of these points is used to find the overall distance dependent coef- ficient.
By far the most common technique for minimizing possible bias, due to a many records with similar as- sociated distances and magnitudes, is weighted regres-
sion. Huo and Hu (1991) divide their dataspace into magnitude – distance intervals within which each record has a weight equal to the reciprocal of the number of records within that interval and then all subdivisions have equal weight. Similar schemes have been implemented by Caillot and Bard (1993) and Crouse and McGuire (1996). Si and Midorikawa (2000) give near-source records much higher weight than those from large distances. Caillot and Bard (1993) and Munson and Thurber (1997) find that weighting can have a significant effect on the pre- dictions.
To give more weight to near-field PGA values, which are more important for engineering design, Bolt and Abrahamson (1982) use non-linear regres- sion on the untransformed PGA rather than on the logarithm of PGA. They believe that the equation derived by Joyner and Boore (1981) is not strongly affected by the near-field data, limiting its useful- ness. The statistical assumption behind the analysis of Bolt and Abrahamson (1982) is that the uncer- tainty associated with PGA is the same for all levels of ground motion (Draper and Smith, 1981, pp. 237 – 238). This assumption must be false because otherwise using the standard deviation associated with the equation, to derive predicted ground motion for percentiles less than 50%, would lead to the prediction of negative PGA (by definition a positive quantity). Also working directly on the untrans- formed PGA violates the requirement of the standard least-squares method that the residuals be homosce- dastic, i.e. that the residuals are similarly distributed with respect to the predicted value and the independ- ent parameters.
The problem of well-recorded earthquakes (for example San Fernando, Imperial Valley and North- ridge) having an unwanted strong influence on the regression (as noted by Trifunac, 1976) is also usually reduced through a weighting scheme; an idea first introduced by Campbell (1981). Campbell (1981) divides the dataspace into a number of dis- tance intervals within which each record is weighted by a relative weighting factor equal to the reciprocal of the number of records within that interval from the earthquake with which the record is associated. Variations on this procedure have been adopted by McCann and Echezwia (1984), Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989), Campbell (1989, 1997), Niazi and

Bozorgnia (1991), Sun and Peng (1993) and Sharma (1998). The two-stage method of Joyner and Boore (1981) also reduces the bias due to well-recorded shocks. The opposite weighting is applied by Si and Midorikawa (2000) who give more weighting to the well-recorded earthquakes. Donovan and Bornstein (1978) find that, although 32% of their data is from one earthquake (San Fernando), no bias is introduced.
Campbell (1997) tries to reduce the bias due to a number of recordings being made at close sites during the same earthquake (the same possible bias that Boore et al., 1993 reduce by including only one record from similar sites which were less than 1 km apart) through a weighting scheme.
Ambraseys and Bommer (1991) choose not to apply weights with their regression analysis because it involves assumptions which are difficult to verify. The ordinary least-squares method is applied by Xu et al. (1984), who justify its use by the small number of records they employ. Campbell and Bozorgnia (sub- mitted for publication) do not apply weights for their regression because of the relatively uniform distribu- tion of their recordings with respect to magnitude and distance.
The final reason for not using the ordinary least- squares technique is so that the coefficients obtained are physically realistic. For highly non-linear forms of the equation, where a small change in one coefficient strongly affects another coefficient’s value, special techniques need to be employed. Dahle et al. (1995) use a Bayesian one-stage method to yield physically possible coefficients. Crouse and McGuire (1996) apply constraints to their coeffi- cients so that predicted ground motion is an increas- ing function magnitude and decreasing function of distance. Kamiyama et al. (1992) obtain one of their coefficients, which controls how far the flat part of the attenuation curve (where there is no decay with distance) extends, by a trial and error process so it is consistent with empirical estimates of fault length. If the unconstrained coefficients are nonphysical then it means that the data used is insufficient for the complexity of equation employed. This is a problem with McVerry et al. (2000) who use a very complex functional form for their ground motion estimation relation and then must use many coefficients from Abrahamson and Silva (1997) because their set is insufficient to derive realistic coefficients. Campbell
(1997) notes that his adopted functional form has too many coefficients so it is necessary to perform the analysis in many steps finding different sets of coefficients at each stage to ensure a stable result is obtained. Yamabe and Kanai (1988) apply a two- stage regression, which removes the problems caused by products of independent variables because the two stages consist of ordinary linear regression. This method though cannot be used for the vast majority of non-linear functional forms which have been proposed.
The other method for obtaining physically realistic coefficients is by using subsets of the data for different parts of the analysis. This is especially useful for data which is dominated by far-field records but where the adopted equation involves coefficients which are only important in the near field. Donovan and Bornstein (1978) divide their data according to distance and find the equation by least squares (no details of this process are provided in the paper). Abrahamson and Litehiser (1989) group their data into 0.5 magnitude unit intervals and fit simple equations to each subset, the coeffi- cients of which are then used to find the overall functional form and coefficients of their non-linear distance saturation term, which controls the predicted ground motion in the near field. A similar technique is employed by Huo and Hu (1991) and Si and Midorikawa (2000) to find the coefficients of their distance saturation terms although they use the data from a selection of earthquakes rather than magni- tude-binned data. Only the earthquakes associated with the most reliable information (those with Ms&gt;6.0) are used by Theodulidis and Papazachos (1992) to find distance coefficients which forces them to adopt a four-stage regression technique to incorporate all the other data.
Schenk (1982, 1984) fits the equation to PGA values by eye and not through regression analysis. Schenk (1982) does this because the least squares method is often highly dependent on marginal obser- vations, meaning that certain points can have a large influence on the derived coefficients. Although this is true, fitting an equation by eye is not an objective method, and so cannot be repeated by another person and get the same result, and it is impossible to use for complicated functional forms where the data cannot be visualised easily.

Only one published ground motion estimation relation (Huo and Hu, 1991) makes the important observation that the independent variables used in ground motion estimation relations (for example magnitude and distance) are associated with their own uncertainties. They develop a method based on weighted consistent least-squares which takes the uncertainties in magnitude and distance into account when deriving the equation. The equations and stand- ard derivations derived by (Huo and Hu, 1991) using this method and using a standard method that assumes the independent parameters are exact are similar. For prediction purposes, it is best to assume that there are no errors in the independent parameters because the standard method gives the equation that minimises the least-squares error in prediction. However, if the coefficients in the equation are of interest, for exam- ple to compare with coefficients predicted on a theoretical basis, then a regression method that assumes there are errors in the independent parame- ters is better.
Brillinger and Preisler (1984, 1985) introduce the maximum-likelihood method for deriving equations for the estimation of strong ground motion. The method is also known as the random effects method (Abrahamson and Youngs, 1992). In the random- effects technique, the error is assumed to consist of two parts: an earthquake-to-earthquake component, which is the same for all records from the same earthquake, and a record-to-record component, which expresses the variability between each record not expressed by the earthquake-to-earthquake compo- nent. The standard deviation of these two errors is found along with the coefficients. This method is thought to take better account of the fact that each record from the same earthquake is not strictly independent. Joyner and Boore (1993) provide a good discussion of this method. This regression method has become the most commonly used method and is used by, for example, Boore et al. (1993), Abrahamson and Silva (1997) and Spudich et al. (1999).
12. Conclusions
From the above discussion, it can be seen that little agreement has been reached in the past 30 years
of ground motion estimation relation studies, in terms of data selection; characterisation of source, path or site; or regression techniques employed. Workers have chosen their techniques based on the available data, which varies greatly with geograph- ical region.
The method chosen must also depend on the purpose to which the equations are to be used. For example, if the equations are to be used for seismic hazard analysis of a large region for which only crude site information is available deriving an equation using complex site factors which are diffi- cult to correlate with the crude site information would make the hazard analysis more complicated, although the derived equations with the complex site factors may model the physics of the problem better. If, however, the equation was to be used for a specific site for which detailed soil and wave velocity profiles are available including complex site response modelling in the equation would be justi- fied and useful.
The ground motion recorded during a particular earthquake at a particular site is the result of a nonlinear combination of many factors. As has been shown above, many different choices have been made in deriving equations for the estimation of strong ground motion therefore it is difficult to correlate apparent differences in the estimated ground motions the seismotectonic conditions of the areas where the accelerograms used were re- corded. This is because of differences in magnitude scale, distance metric and site classifications used, functional form adopted and, probably mainly, because of the distribution of the data used in terms of magnitude and distance.
Estimated ground motions from recent equations for most combinations of magnitude and distance match closely (see Fig. 2). Estimated ground motions from early equations, however, show a large dispersion, see Fig. 9 which shows differences of up to a factor of ten in predicted PGA for a Mw = 4.5 earthquake at df = 50 km using the equa- tions of Trifunac (1976) and Esteva and Villaverde (1973). The large differences in early equations to estimate ground motions are because of a lack of data, especially near-field data from large earth- quakes, a lack of detailed source, path and site information and the simple techniques used to

Fig. 9. Comparison of scaling of horizontal peak ground acceleration at rock sites with Mw in four early equations to estimate strong ground motions from shallow crustal strike-slip earthquakes for two distances: (a) df, dr = 10 km and ds = 10.4 km and (b) df, dr = 50 km and ds = 50.1 km, where df is shortest distance to surface projection of rupture, dr is shortest distance to rupture and ds is shortest distance to seismogenic rupture. These distances correspond to distances from a vertical fault with depth to seismogenic layer of 3 km. The curves are plotted for those magnitudes which fall within the magnitude range of the data used to derive the equation. Assumed magnitude scales (mainly ML) used by the authors of these studies equal Mw for magnitude range of interest.
 
derive the equations. As strong-motion data has become more quantiful and of higher quality and the techniques used to derive the equations more sophisticated the predicted ground motions have be- come more similar.
There are, however, a number of important questions in ground motion estimation on which there is disagreement. Examples of these are given below.
. For which regions of the world are strong ground motions significantly different than ground motions in other regions? If ground motions in certain regions of the world are sufficiently similar to those in other regions data from these different areas can be com-
bined to improve the robustness of the derived equa- tions.
. How do near-field ground motion amplitudes scale with magnitude?
. What is the most appropriate distance metric to use? This will depend on the type of data available (it is impossible to use a complex metric where informa- tion on the fault rupture is not available) and also on the type of earthquakes under consideration (focal depth has been shown to significantly affect ground motion amplitudes and hence its inclusion for areas affected by deep earthquakes is important).
. What is the best way to include site effects into the equations?

 Fig. 10. Uncertainty in published equations for the estimation of horizontal peak ground acceleration against date when the equation was first published. Uncertainty is expressed as a factor of one standard deviation; therefore since almost all equations are derived using the logarithm of acceleration the uncertainty is either exp(r) or 10r depending on whether natural or common logarithms are used, where r is the report standard deviation. The shape of the marker indicates the method of combining the two horizontal components, where o means larger horizontal component is used, 5 means mean horizontal component (geometric or arithmetic) is used, w means both horizontal components are used, 4 means resolved component is used, E means randomly chosen component is used and 5 means unknown method for combining components is used. The greyshade of the markers indicates the geographical (or tectonic) origin of the data used to derive the equation.

Many factors are known to affect ground motions recorded at a site (Boore, 1983; Joyner, 1987; Joyner and Boore, 1988; Anderson, 1991; Douglas, 2001b) that are neglected in currently used equations for the estimation of earthquake ground motions. These fac- tors include: stress conditions in the crust including stress drop (both static and dynamic), rupture prop- agation leading to directivity effects, radiation pattern, differing decay rates for different types of wave, variations in subsurface topography (basin effects), focussing and topography. Neglecting these factors leads to large standard deviations when such equa- tions are used. These large standard deviations mean that earthquake engineers must include large factors of safety into their designs. Fig. 10 shows the uncertainty (defined in as a factor of one standard deviation) of published equations for the estimation of horizontal peak ground acceleration against the date when the equation was first published. It shows that in the past 30 years there has been little or no decrease in the associated standard deviations of the calculated equa- tions to estimate strong ground motions. This article has showed, however, that each step of the procedure followed in deriving these equations has been scruti- nised and improvements suggested.
In order to improve the precision of ground motion estimates new independent parameters, such as more sophisticated site characterisation, need to be included into the equations. Examples of such independent parameters that should be included in future equa- tions, because they can be measured before an earth- quake occurs, are static stress drop and crustal structure, both of which are regionally dependent; the effect of basins, which is especially important for long-period ground motions; resonance and impe- dance effects in the soil deposits beneath the site; and non-linear site response. To include these effects needs, however, detailed information which, unfortu- nately, is currently lacking, especially in Europe and the Middle East. Ground motion estimation using strong-motion records is still a rapidly evolving sub- ject and every year about five new sets of equations are derived and published. Therefore a future review such as this will probably emphasise different points than considered here. Future studies should concen- trate on trying to answer the still outstanding issues mentioned above and should make full use of the available data.

Notes to Table A1:
1 State that it is Richter magnitude which assume to be ML.
2 Ambraseys and Bommer (1995) state that uses 38 earthquakes.
3 Ambraseys and Bommer (1995) state that uses larger component.
4 Note only valid for R z 20 km.
5 Note only valid for R V 200 km.
6 Total earthquake components (does not need to be multiplied by two) for magnitude and distance dependence. Uses 2713 underground
nuclear explosion records for site dependence.
7 Idriss (1978) finds magnitudes to be mixture of ML and Ms.
8 Total earthquake components (does not need to be multiplied by two).
9 Idriss (1978) believes majority are Ms.
10 Idriss (1978) finds magnitudes to be mixture of ML, mb and Ms.
11 Reported in Idriss (1978).
12 Assume dip-slip means normal mechanism.
13 State that it is Richter magnitude which assume to be ML.
14 Reported in Joyner and Boore (1988).
15 Reported in Joyner and Boore (1988).
16 Reported in Joyner and Boore (1988).
17 Consider equations valid for Mw V 8.
18 Free (1996) believes it is dh.
19 This is Ms.
20 Total number of components does not need to be multiplied by two.
21 Distance to centre of array.
22 Total number of components does not need to be multiplied by two.
23 Boore et al. (1997) revise this magnitude to 5.87. New minimum magnitude is 5.2.
24 Considers equation valid for M z 4.7.
25 Considers equation valid for d V 300 km.
26 Equations stated to be for distances up to 100 km.
27 Boore et al. (1997) revise this magnitude to 5.87. New minimum magnitude is 5.2.
28 Coefficients given in Boore et al. (1994b).
29 Free (1996) believes it is largest horizontal component.
30 It is not clear whether Richter magnitude (ML) or Mw was used.
31 Some may be mb because in their Table 1 some earthquakes do not have Ms but have mb. If so, new minimum is 5.0.
32 They state it is ‘closest distance from the exposure of ruptured part of the fault, instead of focal distances’ so may not be rupture distance.
33 It is not clear whether Richter magnitude (ML) or Mw was used.
34 Also derive equations for Australia and N.E. China.
35 Ambraseys et al. (1996) state it is two-stage of Joyner and Boore (1981) but in fact it is two-stage method of Joyner and Boore (1988).
36 Ambraseys et al. (1996) state it is two-stage of Joyner and Boore (1981) but in fact it is two-stage method of Joyner and Boore (1988).
37 Includes some not used for regression.
38 Total number of components does not need to be multiplied by two.
39 Equations stated to be for distances up to 100 km.
40 Total number of components does not need to be multiplied by two.
41 Equation for corrected PGA uses 443 records.
42 Equation for corrected PGA uses 439 records.
43 Equation for corrected PGA uses data from 36 earthquakes.
44 Assuming they use same data as Monguilner et al. (2000b).
45 Smit et al. (2000) give dh but this is typographical error Smit (2000).
46 Shallow crustal records.
47 Subduction records.
48 There are 960 components for uncorrected PGA.
49 There are 941 components for uncorrected PGA.
50 For horizontal corrected records. There are 49 for horizontal uncorrected PGA. There are 36 for vertical corrected records and 46 for
vertical uncorrected PGA.

Discussion
Limitations and Future Work</Text>
            <Notes>The purpose of the discussion section is to interpret and contextualise your data. You should begin by reiterating the purpose of your research and your major findings. Then you might do any or all of the following: connect your findings to other research (published or that of your peers); describe any ambiguities and sources of error in the data, and suggest future experiments to resolve uncertainties; explain where you expect your work may lead, and suggest specific experiments for extending your findings; describe any conceptual or technical limitations of the research. Finally, you should explain the significance of your findings to basic science and to engineering applications. Like the previous sections, the discussion should have a clear organisation and narrative flow, whether or not you use sub-sections.

Relates results to those of others
• Cites other work discussed
• Relates results to theory
• Discuss limitations and weakness of results
• Discuss implications for further research
• Suggest applications of findings when appropriate
• Avoids undue speculations

The DISCUSSION interprets the results in light of the project's objectives. The most important goal of the DISCUSSION section is to interpret the results so that the reader is informed of the insight or answers that the results provide. The DISCUSSION should also present an evaluation of the particular approach taken by the group. For example: Based on the results, how could the experimental procedure be improved? What additional, future work may be warranted? What recommendations can be drawn?

The main body of the report is where you discuss your material. The facts and evidence you have gathered should be analysed and discussed with specific reference to the problem or issue. If your discussion section is lengthy you might divide it into section headings. Your points should be grouped and arranged in an order that is logical and easy to follow. Use headings and subheadings to create a clear structure for your material. Use bullet points to present a series of points in an easy-to-follow list. 

Discussion. Discuss the meaning of the results, stating clearly what their significance is. Compare the results with theoretical expectations and account for anything unexpected.

Explain in the discussion section of your document information presented in the results section, commenting on significant data produced by the study. In writing a discussion section, keep the following points in mind.

• Identify significant patterns in the data and relationships between variables. Offer tentative explanations for these patterns and relationships.
• Compare the actual data produced with any predictions or questions posed in the introduction or theory section of the document.
• If any of the results differ from the expected results, offer possible explanations for the discrepancies. Present the most probable explanations first and the least probable last.
• Consider how well the data answer any questions posed in the document's introduction. Do the results answer the questions completely? If not, explain what questions still need to be addressed and give possible explanations why the results may be inconclusive.
• Qualify the scope of your explanations, discussing in what cases your explanations apply and in what cases they may not.
• Organise your material in order of importance to your reader's purpose in using the document.

            <Notes>References are generally used in the Introduction and Discussion sections to support any claims that are not common knowledge. Include only those references that pertain to the question at hand. Journals vary considerably in their preferred format for the reference list. For this class, you should list the references alphabetically by the first author’s last name. Include all the authors, the paper’s title, the name of the journal in which it was published, its year of publication, the volume number, and page numbers. Please carefully follow the punctuation and format requirements. 

The REFERENCES section should contain complete citations following standard form. The form of the citation depends on the type of source being referenced, and is different for whole books, chapters in books, and articles published in a journal. One good format to follow is that used in the Chemical Engineering Progress journal, published by AIChE. The references should be numbered and listed in the order they were cited in the body of the report. In the text of the report, a particular reference can be cited by using a numerical superscript that corresponds to its number in the reference list. If a reference has not been actually consulted, it should be listed "as discussed in [name of the work that discussed the reference]".

Your bibliography should list, in alphabetical order by author, all published sources referred to in your report. There are different styles of using references and bibliographies. Refer to the study guide Referencing and Bibliographies and check your departmental handbook for guidelines. Texts which you consulted but did not refer to directly could be grouped under a separate heading such as 'Background Reading' and listed in alphabetical order using the same format as in your bibliography. 

Bibliography. List alphabetically any works referred to in your study. Follow the bibliographical and footnote formats of your department or of a prominent periodical published by a professional society in your field.

Las limitaciones en la incorporación y propagación de las incertidumbres asociadas a la estimación de la respuesta dinámica de estructuras complejas constituyen un desafío importante en los métodos actuales de análisis probabilístico de problemas sísmicos y establece la motivación principal del presente trabajo de Investigación 
Las metodologías actuales de análisis dinámico de estructuras geotécnicas en general, y las presas de enrocado en particular como mega estructuras de alto impacto ambiental, requieren modelos numéricos especiales que permitan analizar millones de escenarios de registros sísmicos y propiedades materiales a un bajo costo computacional. 
La imposibilidad de analizar un gran número de registros mediante modelos computacionales complejos (predictores robustos) establece la necesidad de modelos de predicción simplificado (predictores sesgados) que permitan seleccionar los registros sísmicos críticos y establecer el intervalo de confianza de la predicción. 
La naturaleza de los problemas requiere predictores de decenas o cientos de parámetros que solo pueden abordarse mediante métodos numéricos especializados del análisis estadístico relacionados con el aprendizaje de máquina. Por otra parte, las limitaciones del estado actual de la práctica en la predicción de la intensidad sísmica mediante modelos escalares de peligro sísmico, requiere la generalización del modelo PSHA a un modelo vectorial de varias medidas de intensidad que puedan correlacionarse luego con los parámetros del predictor</Text>

Limitations and Future Work</Text>
            <Notes>The purpose of the discussion section is to interpret and contextualise your data. You should begin by reiterating the purpose of your research and your major findings. Then you might do any or all of the following: connect your findings to other research (published or that of your peers); describe any ambiguities and sources of error in the data, and suggest future experiments to resolve uncertainties; explain where you expect your work may lead, and suggest specific experiments for extending your findings; describe any conceptual or technical limitations of the research. Finally, you should explain the significance of your findings to basic science and to engineering applications. Like the previous sections, the discussion should have a clear organisation and narrative flow, whether or not you use sub-sections.

Relates results to those of others
• Cites other work discussed
• Relates results to theory
• Discuss limitations and weakness of results
• Discuss implications for further research
• Suggest applications of findings when appropriate
• Avoids undue speculations

The DISCUSSION interprets the results in light of the project's objectives. The most important goal of the DISCUSSION section is to interpret the results so that the reader is informed of the insight or answers that the results provide. The DISCUSSION should also present an evaluation of the particular approach taken by the group. For example: Based on the results, how could the experimental procedure be improved? What additional, future work may be warranted? What recommendations can be drawn?

The main body of the report is where you discuss your material. The facts and evidence you have gathered should be analysed and discussed with specific reference to the problem or issue. If your discussion section is lengthy you might divide it into section headings. Your points should be grouped and arranged in an order that is logical and easy to follow. Use headings and subheadings to create a clear structure for your material. Use bullet points to present a series of points in an easy-to-follow list. 

Discussion. Discuss the meaning of the results, stating clearly what their significance is. Compare the results with theoretical expectations and account for anything unexpected.

Explain in the discussion section of your document information presented in the results section, commenting on significant data produced by the study. In writing a discussion section, keep the following points in mind.

• Identify significant patterns in the data and relationships between variables. Offer tentative explanations for these patterns and relationships.
• Compare the actual data produced with any predictions or questions posed in the introduction or theory section of the document.
• If any of the results differ from the expected results, offer possible explanations for the discrepancies. Present the most probable explanations first and the least probable last.
• Consider how well the data answer any questions posed in the document's introduction. Do the results answer the questions completely? If not, explain what questions still need to be addressed and give possible explanations why the results may be inconclusive.
• Qualify the scope of your explanations, discussing in what cases your explanations apply and in what cases they may not.
• Organise your material in order of importance to your reader's purpose in using the document.

            <Notes>Appendices contain supporting information, such as transcripts of interviews, results of surveys, a glossary and results from experiments.

Under this heading you should include all the supporting information you have used that is not published. This might include tables, graphs, questionnaires, surveys or transcripts. Refer to the appendices in the body of your report.

Appendixes. Provide detailed calculations, procedures, data in separate appendixes. Give each appendix a title, a letter (Appendix A, B, C), and an introductory paragraph.

In one or more appendixes, include materials that are not essential parts of your main text but that will provide useful reference information to readers seeking more detail.

The following list presents some typical material that is often included in an appendix.

• Detailed explanations and elaborations too technical for the main text
• Additional diagrams
• Additional tables summarising data
• Long lists
• Experimental protocols or survey questions
• Selected computer code directly relevant to discussions in the main body

Guidelines for Appendixes

• Avoid using appendixes as dumping grounds for raw data that you will be unable to incorporate in the body of the paper.
• If you have more than one appendix, use letters to label them (Appendix A, Appendix B, and so forth).
• Give each appendix an appropriate title.
• Place one specific kind of information in each appendix.
• Begin each appendix on a new page.
• If appropriate, identify and summarise the contexts of an appendix in a short summary paragraph.
• Refer to each appendix in the body of the document.</Notes>

            <Text>Predicción del Movimiento Sísmico
La ingeniería sísmica es el vínculo entre las ciencias de la tierra y la ingeniería. El principal aporte de la ingeniería sísmica al diseño de ingeniería es la definición de las cargas sísmicas de diseño en términos de su nivel y frecuencia de ocurrencia durante la vida útil de una estructura. Un método para estimar estas cargas es a través de ecuaciones basadas en los movimientos fuertes del suelo registrados durante terremotos anteriores. 
En los modelos de inferencia paramétricos, las ecuaciones de predicción de intensidad del movimiento sísmico, tambien llamados GMPE (ground-motion prediction equations),  tienen un conjunto de parámetros independientes, como la magnitud y la distancia entre la fuente y el lugar, y un parámetro dependiente  como la aceleración máxima del terreno (PGA) o la aceleración espectral, y los coeficientes de la ecuación se suelen encontrar mediante regresión lineal que en algunos casos siguen ciertas relaciones funcionales asociadas a los mecanismos.
Los modelos mecanicistas, por otra parte, pretenden capturar la verdadera relación funcional que existe entre las variables predictoras (Magnitud, Distancia) y la variable a predecir (Intensidad) a partir de la naturaleza física de los fenómenos de generación. La mayoría de los GMPE publicados tienen alguna base física, y por esa razón están presentes algunos aspectos de los modelos funcionales. Sin embargo dado que no se conocen en detalle todos los aspectos físicos asociados al movimiento sísmico del suelo y, aunque se conocieran, sería imposible expresarlos en forma de una simple ecuación, las ecuaciones de estimación del movimiento del suelo son en general modelos empíricos (estadísticos). 
Selección de Datasets
Una de las principales decisiones que se toman es los datos de qué país, región o régimen sismotectónico se van a utilizar. Lo más frecuente es que los autores sólo utilicen datos de un país (o de una parte del país)

</Text>
            <Notes>Modelos
Draper y Smith (1981) definen tres tipos principales de modelos matemáticos utilizados por los científicos:
Modelos de Control. Cuando los efectos independientes de cada una de las variables de control (las variables predictoras) pueden estimarse mediante el diseño de experimentos. 
Modelos Funcionales. Cuando se conoce y se utiliza la verdadera relación funcional entre la respuesta (el valor a predecir) y las variables predictoras. 
Modelos Predictivos. Cuando no se pueden utilizar modelos funcionales ni de control y dentro de los datos existe mucha intercorrelación, los llamados "problemas de datos desordenados". No es necesario que sean funcionales.
Evidentemente, no se pueden realizar experimentos controlados con los movimientos del suelo causados por los terremotos porque no hay dos terremotos iguales, ni las trayectorias hasta la estación, ni las condiciones locales del lugar y, por lo tanto, no hay repetibilidad. Por lo tanto, los modelos de control no son posibles.</Notes>

            <Text>Caracterización y Clasificación del Movimiento Sísmico
Estado de la práctica en la formulación de modelos de predicción del la intensidad del movimiento sísmico para diferentes regiones y mecanismos de generación, requiere el empleo de grandes conjuntos de datos (datasets) de registros sísmicos   
Si bien las bases de datos de registros sísmicos cuentan con un numero cada vez mayor de registros sísmicos, esto en general sólo ocurre las regiones desarrolladas del mundo (Ej, California, Taiwan, Japón, Nueva Zelandia ) y no siempre son accesibles públicamente. En la mayoría de las regiones de alta sismicidad en el mundo, es raro contar con un número suficiente de registros sísmicos de movimiento fuerte medidos en roca  
Para salvar este inconveniente, los datasets que se emplean para formular un modelo de predicción de intensidad, se suelen configurar con registros de todo el mundo que impacta en un alto grado de dispersión (scattering) en la capacidad productiva de los mismos, particularmente para eventos de movimiento fuerte. 
Los modelos paramétricos más sofisticados de predicción, emplean además de la magnitud y la distancia a la fuente, parámetros tales como  
Para disponer de un número adecuado de registros sísmicos para el análisis, es necesario identificar características específicas de series temporales obtenidas en diferentes regiones del mundo, y diseñar métricas adecuadas para calcular distancias entre los diferentes grupos, de modo tal de agrupar registros de aceleraciones en diferentes clases o categorías, sin distinción de regiones, mecanismos o medidas de intensidad.

            <Notes>Note that in the “Metadata” pane of the Inspector, under “Section Type”, the “Default Subdocument Type” is set to “Front Matter”. This setting causes all subdocuments of this folder to use the “Front Matter” section type by default (that is, when “Structure-Based” is selected as the section type).

This saves us from having to manually assign the “Front Matter” section type for each document we place into this folder.

During Compile, documents assigned the “Front Matter” section type will be laid out differently from documents in the main body of the manuscript.</Notes>

            <Text>1.4 Recent Machine Learning in Digital Signal Processing
We are facing a totally new era inDSP. In this new  scenario, the particular characteristics of signals and data are challenging the traditional signal-processing technologies. Signal and data streams are now massive, unreliable, unstructured, and barely fit standard statistical assumptions about the underlying system. The recent advances in interdisciplinary research are of paramount importance to develop new technologies able to deal with the new scenario. Powerful approaches have been designed for advanced signal processing, which can be implemented thanks to continuous advances in fast comput- ing (which is becoming increasingly inexpensive) and algorithmic developments.

1.4.1 Traditional Signal Assumptions Are No Longer Valid
Standard signal-processing models have traditionally relied on the rather simplifying and strong assumptions of linearity, Gaussianity, stationarity, circularity, causality, and uniform sampling. These models provide mathematical tractability and simple and fast algorithms, but they also constrain their performance and applicability. Current approaches try to get rid of these approximations in a number of ways: 
by widely using models that are intrinsically nonlinear and nonparametric; 
by encoding the relations between the signal and noise (which are often modeled and no longer considered Gaussian independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise); 
by using new approaches to treat the non circularity and non stationarity properties of signals; 
by learning in anti- causal systems, which is an important topic of control theory; and, in some situations, since the acquired signals and data streams are fundamentally unstructured, 
by not assuming uniform sampling of the representation domain. 

It is also important to take into account the increasing diversity of data. For example, large and unstructured text and multimedia datasets stored in the Internet and the increasing use of social network media produce masses of unstructured heterogeneous data streams. Techniques for document classification, part-of-speech tagging, multimedia tagging or classification, together with massive data-processing techniques (known as “big data” techniques) relying on machine-learning theory try to get rid of unjustified assumptions about the data-generation mechanisms.

            <Text>Conclusion</Text>
            <Notes>The conclusion should draw out the implications from the report and normally recommends a course of action. It should link back to the introduction.

The CONCLUSIONS should summarise the central points made in the Discussion section, reinforcing for the reader the value and implications of the work. If the results were not definitive, specific future work that may be needed can be (briefly) described. The conclusions should never contain "surprises". Therefore, any conclusions should be based on observations and data already discussed. It is considered extremely bad form to introduce new data in the conclusions.

In the conclusion you should show the overall significance of what has been covered. You may want to remind the reader of the most important points that have been made in the report or highlight what you consider to be the most central issues or findings. However, no new material should be introduced in the conclusion. 

Conclusions. Review the results in relation to the original problem statement. Assess the success of the study in light of the criteria of success you gave in the introduction.

Include a conclusion as the final part of the body of your document. Because some readers of documents, particularly managers, will sometimes not read the entire document but, instead, focus on the conclusion, this part of the document should summarise all essential information necessary for your audience's purpose. In your conclusion:

• Relate your findings to the general problem and any specific objectives posed in your introduction. 
• Summarise clearly what the report does and does not demonstrate.
• Include specific recommendations for action or for further research. Sometimes these recommendations will constitute a separate section of a document.

            <Title>Motivación</Title>
            <Text>Las presas de materiales sueltos, empleadas en los depósitos de relaves y en reservorios de agua en complejos hidroeléctricos, son estructuras geotécnicas que pueden alcanzar más de 300 m de altura y varios km de longitud y constituyen en la actualidad las estructuras más grandes construidas por el hombre. El 90% de las presas de relaves alto riesgo de todo el mundo, están localizadas en zonas sísmicas de gran actividad y sobre este total, el 60% tienen poblaciones cercanas aguas-abajo del depósito. 
La estimación de la respuesta dinámica y la demanda sísmica (las deformaciones permanentes o residuales) requiere modelos numéricos avanzados que suelen tener un alto costo computacional. Cuando son sometidas a eventos sísmicos de gran intensidad, las estructuras de materiales sueltos pueden acusar grandes deformaciones y desplazamientos durante la historia de deformaciones que alteran sus propiedades mecánicas y dinámicas y requieren en general formulaciones constitutivas avanzadas para materiales con propiedades dependientes de la presión y la amplitud de la deformación, requieren condiciones de borde dependientes de la velocidad (viscosas), requieren parámetros dinámicos dependientes del número de ciclos de carga y descarga (amortiguamientos histeréticos) y emplean mallas de discretización con gran número de elementos para poder capturar geometrías complejas. Estos modelos en general requieren instancias de modelación previa que simulen los procesos constructivos que determinan las propiedades iniciales de los materiales, antes de ser sometidos a un movimiento sísmico en su base. 
Por otra parte, en las grandes presas de enrocado, los estados de tensiones que se inducen en el material de fundación pueden alterar las características mecánicas de estos materiales y afectar la historia de aceleraciones que requiere la presa en su base, y por esa razón los modelos computacionales de estas estructuras requieren no sólo el modelamiento de la estructura sino además de un volumen importante del material de fundación afectado por esos campos de tensiones y deformaciones. Cuando se limita el tamaño máximo de los elementos o diferencias finitas a unos pocos metros, para poder capturar correctamente ciertas longitudes de onda, estas mallas tridimensionales fácilmente pueden alcanzar varios millones de elementos finitos, con la complejidad numérica descrita anteriormente. Luego, el estado actual del arte en la modelación numérica de problemas dinámicos de interacción presenta desafíos importantes para poder incorporar y propagar adecuadamente las incertidumbres epistémicas asociadas a la modelación numérica (mediante árboles lógicos o simulaciones de Montecarlo) debido al alto costo computacional que implica el análisis dinámico de un simple escenario.
La respuesta dinámica en una presa de materiales sueltos es el campo de desplazamientos y aceleraciones resultante a un movimiento sísmico en su base. La medida de intensidad más empleada de un registro sísmico es el valor máximo de las aceleraciones que registra esa historia (PGA). Las estructuras deformables responden en general de manera diferente a registros sísmicos de la misma intensidad (PGA) pero con contenido de frecuencia diferente. Las máximas aceleraciones registradas en un punto de la estructura suelen ser diferentes a la máxima intensidad actuando en la base y la respuesta dinámica puede entenderse como la convolución de la señal sísmica con la función de transferencia de la estructura dependiente del período fundamental y del amortiguamiento. 
En las estructuras de materiales cohesivos o cohesivo-friccionales, la máxima demanda sísmica en el régimen elástico se puede expresar en términos de un esfuerzo de corte máximo, asociada a la respuesta dinámica (elástica) de la estructura. Esto permite definir una única envolvente de esfuerzos máximos (espectro) que representa la máxima demanda sísmica que tendrían estructuras con estas características dinámicas, para un cierto nivel de intensidad. En las presas y geo-estructuras de materiales sueltos la respuesta dinámica es fuertemente dependiente del contenido de frecuencias, la duración del registro, el número de ciclos de carga y descarga y otros parámetros espectrales del registro sísmico. Es decir, a diferencia de las estructuras de materiales cohesivos, conocer el PGA en la base de la presa no permite inferir con un factor de amplificación escalar, la máxima demanda sísmica. Dicho de otro modo, la demanda sísmica está pobremente relacionada con la aceleración máxima PGA y depende además de otros parámetros de la historia de aceleraciones. 
La intensidad sísmica se obtiene mediante la estimación del peligro sísmico. La metodología probabilística de estimación del peligro sísmico (PSHA) cuantifica numéricamente las contribuciones de intensidad de todas las fuentes sísmicas conocidas para todas las magnitudes creíbles de todos los eventos que puedan ocurrir en el área de influencia y proporciona las probabilidades de excedencia anual (AEP) de las intensidades esperables en el sitio del proyecto. Esta metodología numérica incorpora la incertidumbre aleatoria dada por la distribución espacial de los hipocentros, la frecuencia anual de ocurrencia de eventos y el error de los los modelos empíricos de estimación de intensidades en función de las distancias al hipocentro, del área de ruptura de cada evento, y los efectos del sitio. Sin embargo, el estado del arte en la predicción de movimientos sísmicos de los modelos empíricos actuales tiene aún una capacidad de predicción muy pobre debido a la enorme dispersión que actualmente reportan estos modelos, con coeficientes de variación cercanos al 100% en muchos casos. Este término es por lejos el factor que más incertidumbre incorpora en toda la metodología y controla el error de las predicciones.
Una limitación de las formulaciones PSHA disponibles en herramientas computacionales, es que los modelos de estimación de intensidades son escalares, es decir, son modelos que predicen un único parámetro del movimiento sísmico, (PGA, o Sa) y por esa razón, tienen una dispersión y variabilidad muy grande, que intentan reducir incorporando muchos parámetros relacionados con la forma del área de ruptura que excepto en pocas regiones en el mundo como las fallas del valle de California, estos parámetros son desconocidos. Luego, se requieren modelos PSHA basados en funciones de distribución conjuntas, que permitan correlacionar adecuadamente varias medidas de intensidad con un escenario de distancias y magnitudes. Los modelos PSHA vectoriales (VPSHA) solo pueden manejarse mediante metodologías avanzadas de regresión numérica y debido a que predicen variables aleatorias no independientes, requieren grandes bases de datos de registros sísmicos para estimar la correlación que existe entre diversas medidas de intensidad
En relación a la incertidumbre epistémica que surge de un conocimiento incompleto de algunas propiedades y parámetros del modelo, el elevado costo computacional de los modelos suele ser un obstáculo para la implementación de metodologías tradicionales de estimación y propagación de la incertidumbre epistémica de los parámetros de un modelo de estas características. Por otra parte, y este es uno de los problemas más difíciles de abordar, el costo computacional de un modelo de este tipo determina en la práctica el análisis de un número muy reducido de registros sísmicos. 
En obras críticas como las presas de reservorio o los depósitos de relaves, es fundamental poder contar con una estimación robusta de las deformaciones permanentes al final del evento sísmico, incluyendo la incertidumbre asociada a esa estimación. Las deformaciones permanentes en estructuras de materiales sueltos dependen fuertemente del contenido de frecuencias y la duración del registro sísmico. Por esta razón, cuando se efectúan análisis dinámicos para un conjunto de registros sísmicos escalados al mismo nivel de intensidad (PGA) la respuesta dinámica de estas estructuras presenta una enorme dispersión y la elección arbitraria de un conjunto reducido de registros producirá indefectiblemente una estimación sesgada de la demanda sísmica y por lo tanto insegura. 
La variabilidad del contenido de frecuencias y la duración de los registros sísmicos sólo puede ser capturada a partir del análisis de cientos o miles de Acelerogramas escalados a diferentes intensidades (niveles de servicio) de modo tal que permitan construir predictores insesgados de demanda sísmica probabilística (PBSD), que se emplearán luego en la estimación de la fragilidad, la vulnerabilidad y el riesgo de las estructuras. En el estado actual de la práctica, esta estrategia de análisis de incertidumbres es imposible aún debido al elevado costo computacional que ya tiene el análisis de unos pocos registros sísmicos, incluyendo no solamente el tiempo de CPU sino además las horas-hombre involucradas en el post-procesamiento e interpretación de los resultados obtenidos. </Text>
            <Comments>Algunos parámetros como la rigidez al corte inicial o la relación de vacíos son dependientes del proceso constructivo y requieren etapas previas que simulen numéricamente dicho proceso para establecer las condiciones iniciales de tensiones y deformaciones en cada nodo de la malla FEM. Otros parámetros dinámicos, como el amortiguamiento o la rigidez a la corte instantánea, son altamente dependientes del nivel de daño que tendrá el material durante la historia de deformaciones.
Las mallas FEM que involucran el análisis de ondas mecánicas, deben tener una separación entre sus nodos adecuada para capturar (discretizar) el pasaje una semionda completa y en general se suele limitar el tamaño máximo del elemento al 10% de la longitud de onda más corta esperable en algún estrato de material. Las ondas mecánicas involucradas en el análisis de deformaciones inducidas por sismos son las ondas de corte y el tamaño máximo del elemento se limita con  donde  es la velocidad de propagación y  es la frecuencia característica del movimiento sísmico. Esta restricción es análoga a las que se derivan de los teoremas de muestreo de ondas y los fenómenos de aliasing
En general, nunca se disponen de registros sísmicos que hayan ocurrido previamente en el sitio de cada proyecto, y se suelen emplear acelerogramas obtenidos en estaciones sismológicas alrededor del mundo para eventos sísmicos similares a los que se esperan en la región y escalados a la intensidad objetivo para la que se diseña cada presa. Sin embargo, las características los suelos de fundación de las estaciones sismológicas rara vez coinciden con las del material de fundación de la presa, y se suelen emplear procedimientos numéricos para corregir numéricamente los registros sísmicos.
La tecnología de elementos finitos de los últimos 20 años ha aportado herramientas que permiten reducir la incertidumbre epistémica con formulaciones constitutivas más sofisticados e interfaces con humanos que facilitan las etapas de discretización y simulación del proceso constructivo. Sin embargo, la instancia de modelación y las hipótesis sobre el comportamiento de los materiales, sigue siendo una tarea exclusiva de los humanos y la elección de los parámetros del modelo, particularmente aquellos que no son medibles en laboratorio o en terreno, continúan siendo parte del juicio experto del analista. La incertidumbre asociada a esta instancia suele considerarse mediante árboles lógicos o simulación de Montecarlo y si bien estas técnicas son muy conocidas y relativamente simples de implementar, el costo computacional de algunos modelos numéricos las hace inviables y son empleadas únicamente en estructuras muy críticas desde el punto de vista de la seguridad a la vida o al medio ambiente.</Comments>
